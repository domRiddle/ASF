# SETTIN UP

IF U ARRIVD HER 4 DA FURST TIEM, WELCOM! WERE VRY HAPPEH 2 C YET ANOTHR TRAVELR DAT IZ INTERESTD IN R PROJECT, ALTHOUGH BEAR IN MIND DAT WIF GREAT POWR COMEZ GREAT RESPONSIBILITY - ASF IZ CAPABLE OV DOIN LOT OV DIFFERENT STEAM-RELATD THINGS, BUT ONLY AS LONG AS U **CARE ENOUGH 2 LERN HOW 2 USE IT** THAR IZ STEEP LERNIN CURVE INVOLVD HER, AN WE EXPECT FRUM U 2 READ TEH WIKI IN DIS REGARD, WHICH EXPLAINS IN DETAIL HOW EVRYTHIN OPERATEZ.

IF URE STILL HER DEN IT MEANZ DAT U ENDURD R TEXT ABOOV, WHICH IZ NICE. Unless you skipped over it, then you're going to have a **[bad time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJgt6m6njVw)** soon enough... ANYWAY, ASF IZ CONSOLE APP, WHICH MEANZ DAT TEH PROGRAM ITSELF DOESNT HAS FRIENDLY GUI DAT URE IN GENERAL USD 2. ASF WUZ MAINLY SUPPOSD 2 BE RUN ON SERVERS, SO IT ACTS AS SERVICE (DAEMON) AN NOT DESKTOP APP.

DIS HOWEVR DOESNT MEEN DAT U CANT USE IT ON UR PC OR USIN IT IN SUM WAI MOAR COMPLICATD THAN USUAL, NOTHIN LIEK DAT. ASF IZ STANDALONE PROGRAM DAT DOESNT NED INSTALLASHUN, AN WERKZ OUT OV TEH BOX RITE AWAY, BUT REQUIREZ CONFIGURASHUN PRIOR 2 BECOMIN USEFUL. CONFIGURASHUN IZ TELLIN ASF WUT IT SHUD IN FACT DO AFTR U LAUNCH IT. IF U LAUNCH IT WITHOUT CONFIGURASHUN, DEN ASF WONT DO ANYTHIN, SIMPLE.

* * *

## OS-SPECIFIC SETUP

In general, here is what we'll do in the next few minutes:

- Install **[.NET Core prerequisites](#net-core-prerequisites)**.
- Download **[latest ASF release](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/releases/latest)** in appropriate OS-specific variant.
- Extract the archive into new location (and `chmod +x ArchiSteamFarm` if you're on Linux/OS X).
- **[Configure ASF](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration)**.
- Launch ASF and see the magic.

SOUNDZ SIMPLE ENOUGH, RITE? SO LETS GIT THRU IT.

* * *

### .NET CORE PREREQUIZIETS

FURST STEP IZ ENSURIN DAT UR OS CAN EVEN LAUNCH ASF PROPERLY. ASF IZ WRITTEN IN C#, BASD ON .NET CORE AN CUD REQUIRE NATIV LIBRARIEZ DAT R NOT AVAILABLE ON UR PLATFORM YET. Depending on whether you use Windows, Linux or OS X, you will have different requirements, although all of them are listed in **[.NET Core prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/install)** document that you should follow. DIS AR TEH R REFERENCE MATERIAL DAT SHUD BE USD, BUT 4 DA SAEK OV SIMPLICITY WEVE ALSO DETAILD ALL NEEDD PACKAGEZ BELOW, SO U DOAN NED 2 READ TEH FULL DOCUMENT.

IZ PERFECTLY NORMAL DAT SUM (OR EVEN ALL) DEPENDENCIEZ ALREADY EXIST ON UR SISTEM DUE 2 BEAN INSTALLD BY THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE DAT URE USIN. STILL, U SHUD ENSURE DAT IZ TRULY TEH CASE BY RUNNIN APPROPRIATE INSTALLR 4 UR OS - WITHOUT DOSE DEPENDENCIEZ ASF WONT LAUNCH AT ALL.

KEEP IN MIND DAT U DOAN NED 2 DO ANYTHIN ELSE 4 OS-SPECIFIC BUILDZ, ESPECIALLY INSTALLIN .NET CORE SDK OR EVEN RUNTIME, SINCE OS-SPECIFIC PACKAGE INCLUDEZ ALL OV DAT ALREADY. U NED ONLY .NET CORE PREREQUIZIETS (DEPENDENCIEZ) 2 RUN .NET CORE RUNTIME INCLUDD IN ASF.

#### **[Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/install/windows)**:

- **[Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable Update](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53587)** (x64 for 64-bit Windows, x86 for 32-bit Windows)
- IZ HIGHLY RECOMMENDD 2 ENSURE DAT ALL WINDOWS UPDATEZ R ALREADY INSTALLD. At the very least you need **[KB2533623](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2533623/microsoft-security-advisory-insecure-library-loading-could-allow-remot)** and **[KB2999226](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2999226/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows)**, but more updates may be needed. ALL OV THEM R ALREADY INSTALLD IF UR WINDOWS IZ UP-2-DATE. ENSURE DAT U MEET DOSE REQUIREMENTS PRIOR 2 INSTALLIN VISUAL C++ PACKAGE.

#### **[Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/install/linux)**:

PACKAGE NAMEZ DEPEND ON TEH LINUX DISTRIBUSHUN DAT URE USIN, WEVE LISTD TEH MOST COMMON ONEZ. U CAN OBTAIN ALL OV THEM WIF NATIV PACKAGE MANAGR 4 UR OS (SUCH AS `APT` 4 DEBIAN OR `NOM` 4 SENTOS).

- `LIBC6` (`LIBC`)
- `libgcc1` (`libgcc`)
- `libicu` (`icu-libs`, latest version for your distribution, for example `libicu67`)
- `libgssapi-krb5-2` (`libkrb5-3`, `krb5-libs`)
- `libssl1.1` (`libssl`, `openssl-libs`, latest version for your distribution, `1.1.X` or `1.0.X`)
- `libstdc++6` (`libstdc++`, in version `5.0` or higher)
- `zlib1g` (`zlib`)

AT LEAST MAJORITY OV DOSE SHUD BE ALREADY NATIVELY AVAILABLE ON UR SISTEM. TEH MINIMAL INSTALLASHUN OV DEBIAN STABLE REQUIRD ONLY `LIBICU63`.

#### **[OS X](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/install/macos)**:

- NONE 4 NAO, BUT U SHUD HAS LATEST VERSHUN OV OS X INSTALLD, AT LEAST 10.13+

* * *

### DOWNLOADIN

Since we have all required dependencies already, the next step is downloading **[latest ASF release](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/releases/latest)**. ASF IZ AVAILABLE IN LOTZ DA VARIANTS, BUT URE INTERESTD IN PACKAGE DAT MATCHEZ UR OPERATIN SISTEM AN ARCHITECCHUR. 4 EXAMPLE, IF URE USIN `64`-BIT `WIN`DOWS, DEN U WANTS `ASF-WIN-X64` PACKAGE. For more information about available variants, visit **[compatibility](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Compatibility)** section. ASF is also able to run on OSes that we're not building OS-specific package for, such as **32-bit Windows**, head over to **[generic setup](#generic-setup)** for that.

![Assets](https://i.imgur.com/Ym2xPE5.png)

AFTR DOWNLOAD, START FRUM EXTRACTIN TEH ZIP FILE INTO ITZ OWN FOLDR. We recommend using **[7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org)**, but all standard utilities like `unzip` from Linux/OS X should work without problems as well.

IF URE USIN LINUX/OS X, DOAN FORGET 2 `CHMOD +X ARCHISTEAMFARM` IN DA EXTRACTD FOLDR, SINCE PERMISHUNS R NOT AUTOMATICALLY SET IN DA ZIP FILE. DIS HAS 2 BE DUN ONLY ONCE AFTR INITIAL UNPACK.

BE ADVISD 2 UNPACK ASF 2 **ITZ OWN DIRECTORY** AN NOT 2 ANY EXISTIN DIRECTORY URE ALREADY USIN 4 SOMETHIN ELSE - ASFS AUTO-UPDATEZ FEACHUR WILL DELETE ALL OLD AN UNRELATD FILEZ WHEN UPGRADIN, WHICH CUD LEAD 2 U LOSIN ANYTHIN UNRELATD U PUT IN ASF DIRECTORY. IF U HAS ANY EXTRA SCRIPTS OR FILEZ DAT U WANTS 2 USE WIF ASF, PUT THEM IN WAN FOLDR ABOOV.

AN EXAMPLE STRUCCHUR WUD LOOK LIEK DIS:

### CONFIGURASHUN

WERE NAO READY 2 DO TEH VRY LAST STEP, TEH CONFIGURASHUN. DIS AR TEH BY FAR TEH MOST COMPLICATD STEP, SINCE IT INVOLVEZ LOT OV NEW INFORMASHUN URE NOT FAMILIAR WIF YET, SO WELL TRY 2 PROVIDE SUM EASY 2 UNDERSTAND EXAMPLEZ AN SIMPLIFID EXPLANASHUN HER.

First and foremost, there is **[configuration](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration)** page that explains **everything** that relates to configuration, but it's a massive amount of new information, a lot of which we don't need to know right away. INSTEAD, WELL TEACH U HOW 2 GIT TEH INFORMASHUN URE AKSHULLY LOOKIN 4.

ASF CONFIGURASHUN CAN BE DUN IN 2 WAYS - EITHR BY USIN R WEB CONFIG GENERATOR, OR MANUALLY. This is explained in-depth in **[configuration](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration)** section, so refer to that if you want more detailed information. WELL USE WEB CONFIG GENERATOR WAI, SINCE IZ MUTCH EASIR.

Navigate to our **[web config generator](https://justarchinet.github.io/ASF-WebConfigGenerator)** page with your favourite browser, you'll need to have javascript enabled in case you manually disabled it. WE RECOMMEND CHROME OR FIREFOX, BUT IT SHUD WERK ON ALL MOST POPULAR BROWSERS.

AFTR OPENIN TEH PAEG, SWITCH 2 "BOT" TAB. U SHUD NAO C PAEG SIMILAR 2 TEH WAN BELOW:

![Bot tab](https://i.imgur.com/aF3k8Rg.png)

IF BY ANY CHANCE TEH VERSHUN OV ASF DAT UVE JUS DOWNLOADD IZ OLDR THAN WUT CONFIG GENERATOR IZ SET 2 USE BY DEFAULT, SIMPLY CHOOSE UR ASF VERSHUN FRUM TEH DROPDOWN MENU. DIS CAN HAPPEN AS TEH CONFIG GENERATOR CAN BE USD 4 GENERATIN CONFIGS 2 NEWR (PRE-RELEASE) ASF VERSHUNS DAT WUZ NOT MARKD AS STABLE YET. UVE DOWNLOADD LATEST STABLE RELEASE OV ASF DAT IZ VERIFID 2 WERK RELIABLY.

START FRUM PUTTIN NAYM 4 UR BOT INTO TEH FIELD HIGHLIGHTD AS RED. DIS CAN BE ANY NAYM UD LIEK 2 USE, SUCH AS UR NICKNAME, AKOWNT NAYM, NUMBR, OR ANYTHIN ELSE. THAR IZ ONLY WAN WERD DAT U CANT USE, `ASF`, AS DAT KEYWORD IZ RESERVD 4 GLOBAL CONFIG FILE. IN ADDISHUN 2 DAT UR BOT NAYM CANT START WIF DOT (ASF INTENSHUNALLY IGNOREZ DOSE FILEZ). WE ALSO RECOMMEND DAT U AVOID USIN SPACEZ, U CAN USE `_` AS WERD SEPARATOR IF NEEDD.

AFTR U DECIDD BOUT UR NAYM, CHANGE `ENABLD` SWITCH 2 BE ON, DIS DEFINEZ WHETHR UR BOT IZ SUPPOSD 2 BE STARTD BY ASF AUTOMATICALLY AFTR LAUNCH (OV TEH PROGRAM).

NAO U CAN DECIDE UPON 2 THINGS:

- U CAN PUT UR LOGIN IN `STEAMLOGIN` FIELD AN UR PASWORD IN `STEAMPASWORD` FIELD
- OR U CAN LEEF THEM EMPTY

DOIN TEH FURST TING WILL ALLOW ASF 2 AUTOMATICALLY USE UR AKOWNT CREDENTIALS DURIN STARTUP, SO U WONT NED 2 INPUT THEM MANUALLY EACH TIEM ASF NEEDZ THEM. U CAN HOWEVR DECIDE 2 OMIT THEM, IN WHICH CASE THEYRE NOT BEAN SAVD, SO ASF WONT BE ABLE 2 AUTOMATICALLY START WITHOUT UR HALP AN ULL NED 2 INPUT THEM DURIN RUNTIME.

ASF REQUIREZ UR LOGIN CREDENTIALS CUZ IT INCLUDEZ ITZ OWN IMPLEMENTASHUN OV STEAM CLIENT AN NEEDZ TEH SAME DETAILS 2 LOG IN AS TEH WAN DAT U USE YOURSELF. UR LOGIN CREDENTIALS R NOT SAVD ANYWHERE BUT ON UR PC IN ASF `CONFIG` DIRECTORY ONLY, R WEB CONFIG GENERATOR IZ CLIENT-BASD WHICH MEANZ DAT TEH CODE IZ RUN LOCALLY IN UR BROWSR 2 GENERATE VALID ASF CONFIGS, WITHOUT DETAILS URE INPUTTIN EVR LEAVIN UR PC IN DA FURST PLACE, SO THAR IZ NO NED 2 WORRY BOUT ANY POSIBLE SENSITIV DATA LEAK.TAILS 2 LOG IN AS TEH WAN DAT U USE YOURSELF. STILL, IF U 4 WHATEVR REASON DOAN WANTS 2 PUT UR CREDENTIALS THAR, WE UNDERSTAND DAT, AN U CAN PUT THEM MANUALLY LATR IN GENERATD FILEZ, OR OMIT THEM ENTIRELY AN PUT THEM ONLY IN ASF COMMAND PROMPT. More on security matter can be found in **[configuration](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration)** section.

U CAN ALSO DECIDE 2 LEEF JUS WAN FIELD EMPTY, SUCH AS `STEAMPASWORD`, ASF WILL DEN BE ABLE 2 USE UR LOGIN AUTOMATICALLY, BUT WILL STILL ASK 4 PASWORD (SIMILAR 2 STEAM CLIENT). IF URE USIN STEAM PARENTAL 2 UNLOCK TEH AKOWNT, ULL NED 2 PUT IT INTO `STEAMPARENTALCODE` FIELD.

AFTR TEH DECISHUN AN OPSHUNAL DETAILS, UR WEB PAEG WILL NAO LOOK SIMILAR 2 TEH WAN BELOW:

![Bot tab 2](https://i.imgur.com/yf54Ouc.png)

U CAN NAO HIT "DOWNLOAD" BUTN AN R WEB CONFIG GENERATOR WILL GENERATE NEW `JSON` FILE BASD ON UR CHOSEN NAYM. SAVE DAT FILE INTO `CONFIG` DIRECTORY WHICH IZ LOCATD IN DA FOLDR WER UVE EXTRACTD R ZIP FILE IN DA PREVIOUS STEP.

UR `CONFIG` DIRECTORY WILL NAO LOOK LIEK DIS:

![Structure 2](https://i.imgur.com/crWdjcp.png)

CONGRATULASHUNS! UVE JUS FINISHD TEH VRY BASIC ASF BOT CONFIGURASHUN. WELL EXTEND DIS SHORTLY, 4 NAO DIS AR TEH EVRYTHIN DAT U NED.

* * *

### RUNNIN ASF

URE NAO READY 2 LAUNCH TEH PROGRAM 4 DA FURST TIEM. SIMPLY DOUBLE-CLICK `ARCHISTEAMFARM` BINARY IN ASF DIRECTORY.

AFTR DOIN SO, ASSUMIN U INSTALLD ALL REQUIRD DEPENDENCIEZ IN DA FURST STEP, ASF SHUD LAUNCH PROPERLY, NOTICE UR FURST BOT (IF U DIDNT FORGET 2 PUT GENERATD CONFIG IN `CONFIG` DIRECTORY), AN ATTEMPT 2 LOG IN:

![ASF](https://i.imgur.com/u5hrSFz.png)

IF U SUPPLID `STEAMLOGIN` AN `STEAMPASWORD` 4 ASF 2 USE, ULL BE ASKD 4 UR STEAMGUARD TOKEN ONLY (E-MAIL, 2FA OR NONE, DEPENDIN ON UR STEAM SETTINGS). IF U DIDNT, ULL ALSO BE ASKD 4 UR STEAM LOGIN AN PASWORD.

Now is a good time to review our **[privacy policy](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Statistics#current-privacy-policy)** section if you're concerned about what will happen next, as stated by ASF itself.

AFTR PASIN THRU INITIAL LOGIN GATE, ASSUMIN UR DETAILS R CORRECT, ULL SUCCESFULLY LOG IN, AN ASF WILL START IDLIN USIN DEFAULT SETTINGS DAT U DIDNT CHANGE AS OV NAO:

![ASF 2](https://i.imgur.com/Cb7DBl4.png)

DIS PROVEZ DAT ASF IZ NAO SUCCESFULLY DOIN ITZ JOB ON UR AKOWNT, SO U CAN NAO MINIMIZE TEH PROGRAM AN DO SOMETHIN ELSE. After enough of time (depending on **[performance](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Performance)**), you'll see Steam trading cards slowly being dropped. Of course, for that to happen you must have valid games to idle, showing as "you can get X more card drops from playing this game" on your **[badges page](https://steamcommunity.com/my/badges)** - if there are no games to idle, then ASF will state that there is nothing to do, as stated in our **[FAQ](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/FAQ#what-is-asf)**.

DIS CONCLUDEZ R VRY BASIC SETTIN UP GUIDE. U CAN NAO DECIDE WHETHR U WANTS 2 CONFIGURE ASF FURTHR, OR LET IT DO ITZ JOB IN DEFAULT SETTINGS. WELL COVR FEW MOAR BASIC DETAILS, DEN LEEF U ENTIRE WIKI 4 DISCOVERY.

* * *

### EXTENDD CONFIGURASHUN

#### IDLIN SEVERAL ACCOUNTS AT ONCE

ASF SUPPORTS IDLIN MOAR THAN WAN AKOWNT AT TIEM, WHICH IZ ITZ PRIMARY FUNCSHUN. U CAN ADD MOAR ACCOUNTS 2 ASF BY GENERATIN MOAR BOT CONFIG FILEZ, IN EGSAKTLY TEH SAME WAI AS UVE GENERATD UR FURST WAN JUS FEW MINUTEZ AGO. U NED 2 ENSURE ONLY 2 THINGS:

- UNIQUE BOT NAYM, IF U ALREADY HAS UR FURST BOT NAMD "MAINACCOUNT", U CANT HAS ANOTHR WAN WIF TEH SAME NAYM.
- VALID LOGIN DETAILS, SUCH AS `STEAMLOGIN`, `STEAMPASWORD` AN `STEAMPARENTALCODE` (IF USIN STEAM PARENTAL SETTINGS)

IN OTHR WERDZ, SIMPLY JUMP 2 CONFIGURASHUN AGAIN AN DO EGSAKTLY TEH SAME, JUS 4 UR SECOND OR THIRD AKOWNT. REMEMBR 2 USE UNIQUE NAMEZ 4 ALL OV UR BOTS.

* * *

#### CHANGIN SETTINGS

U CHANGE EXISTIN SETTINGS IN EGSAKTLY TEH SAME WAI - BY GENERATIN NEW CONFIG FILE. IF U DIDNT CLOSE R WEB CONFIG GENERATOR YET, CLICK ON "TOGGLE ADVANCD SETTINGS" AN C WUT IZ THAR 4 U 2 DISCOVR. 4 DIS TUTORIAL WELL CHANGE `CUSTOMGAMEPLAYEDWHILEFARMIN` SETTIN, WHICH ALLOWS U 2 SET CUSTOM NAYM BEAN DISPLAYD WHEN ASF IZ IDLIN, INSTEAD OV SHOWIN AKSHUL GAME.

SO LETS DO DAT, IF U RUN ASF AN START IDLIN, IN DEFAULT SETTINGS ULL C DAT UR STEAM AKOWNT IZ IN-GAME NAO:

![Steam](https://i.imgur.com/1VCDrGC.png)

LETS CHANGE DAT DEN. TOGGLE ADVANCD SETTINGS IN WEB CONFIG GENERATOR AN FIND `CUSTOMGAMEPLAYEDWHILEFARMIN`. ONCE U DO DAT, PUT UR OWN CUSTOM TEXT THAR DAT U WANTS 2 DISPLAY, SUCH AS "IDLIN CARDZ":

![Bot tab 3](https://i.imgur.com/gHqdEqb.png)

NAO DOWNLOAD TEH NEW CONFIG FILE IN EGSAKTLY TEH SAME WAI, DEN **OVERWRITE** UR OLD CONFIG FILE WIF NEW WAN. U CAN ALSO DELETE UR OLD CONFIG FILE AN PUT NEW WAN IN ITZ PLACE OV COURSE.

ONCE U DO DAT AN START ASF AGAIN, ULL NOTICE DAT ASF NAO DISPLAYS UR CUSTOM TEXT IN PREVIOUS PLACE:

![Steam 2](https://i.imgur.com/vZg0G8P.png)

DIS CONFIRMS DAT UVE SUCCESFULLY EDITD UR CONFIG. IN EGSAKTLY TEH SAME WAI U CAN CHANGE GLOBAL ASF PROPERTIEZ, BY SWITCHIN FRUM BOT TAB 2 "ASF" TAB, DOWNLOADIN GENERATD `ASF.JSON` CONFIG FILE AN PUTTIN IT IN UR `CONFIG` DIRECTORY.

* * *

#### USIN ASF-UI

ASF IZ CONSOLE APP AN DOESNT INCLUDE GRAFICAL USR INTERFACE. However, we're actively working on **[ASF-ui](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/IPC#asf-ui)** frontend to our IPC interface, which can be a very decent and user-friendly way to access various ASF features.

IN ORDR 2 USE ASF-UI, U SHUD ENSURE DAT U SET UP `IPC` AN `STEAMOWNERID` GLOBAL CONFIGURASHUN PROPERTIEZ (ASF TAB).

4 `STEAMOWNERID`, U NED 2 INPUT UNIQUE STEAM IDENTIFICATOR IN 64-BIT FORM OV UR AKOWNT. You can look it up in various different ways, we'll use **[SteamRep](https://steamrep.com)** for that purpose. OPEN TEH WEBSIET, LOCATE SIGN IN THRU STEAM BUTN IN TOP RITE CORNR, DEN LOG IN. AFTERWARDZ, IN DA SAME PLACE, CLICK ON UR AVATAR, AN LOOK UP `STEAMID64` FIELD ON UR PROFILE.

![SteamRep](https://i.imgur.com/RUuJ63i.png)

4 MAH AKOWNT, DIS AR TEH `76561198006963719` NUMBR. ULL HAS SIMILAR WAN, ALSO STARTIN FRUM `7656`. COPY IT.

NAO NAVIGATE ONCE AGAIN 2 R WEB CONFIG GENERATOR AN INPUT DAT NUMBR AS STEAMOWNERID.

![SteamOwnerID](https://i.imgur.com/V6jslfQ.png)

U NED 2 DO ONLY WAN MOAR TING, TOGGLE ADVANCD SETTINGS, FIND `IPC` OPSHUN, AN ENABLE IT.

![IPC](https://i.imgur.com/NhujZCN.png)

NAO U CAN DOWNLOAD UR ASF CONFIG AN PUT IT IN UR `CONFIG` DIRECTORY, AS USUAL. AFTERWARDZ, LAUNCH ASF AGAIN, AN U SHUD BE ABLE 2 CONFIRM DAT IT PROPERLY STARTD IPC INTERFACE:

![IPC 2](https://i.imgur.com/ZmkO8pk.png)

If you did everything properly, you'll now be able to access ASF's IPC interface under **[this](http://localhost:1242)** link, as long as ASF is running. You can use ASF-ui for various purposes, e.g. sending **[commands](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands)**. FEELZ FREE 2 TAEK LOOK AROUND IN ORDR 2 FIND OUT ALL ASF-UI FUNCSHUNALITIEZ.

![ASF-UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JustArchiNET/ASF-ui/main/.github/previews/bots.png)

PLZ NOWT DAT ASF-UI IZ CURRENTLY IN PREVIEW STATE AN NOT EVRYTHIN IZ AVAILABLE/WERKIN YET, BUT IZ MOAR THAN ENOUGH 4 SIMPLE ASF USAGE.

* * *

### SUMMARY

UVE SUCCESFULLY SET UP ASF 2 USE UR STEAM ACCOUNTS AN UVE ALREADY CUSTOMIZD IT 2 UR LIKIN LIL. IF U FOLLOWD R ENTIRE GUIDE, DEN U EVEN MANAGD 2 SEND SIMPLE COMMAND THRU R ASF-UI INTERFACE. Now is a good time to read our entire **[configuration](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration)** section in order to learn what all those different settings you've seen in advanced tab actually do, and what ASF can offer. If you've stumbled upon some issue or you have some generic question, read **[FAQ](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/FAQ)** instead which should cover all, or at least majority of questions that you may have. If you want to learn everything about ASF and how it can make your life easier, head over to the rest of **[our wiki](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Home)**. HAS FUN!

* * *

## GENERIC SETUP

This setup is for advanced users that want to set up ASF to run in **[generic](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Compatibility#generic)** variant. It's not recommended for people that can use **[OS-specific setup](#os-specific-setup)**.

U WANTS 2 USE GENERIC VARIANT MAINLY IN DOSE SITUASHUNS (BUT OV COURSE U CAN USE IT REGARDLES):

- WHEN URE USIN OS DAT WE DOAN BUILD OS-SPECIFIC PACKAGE 4 (SUCH AS 32-BIT WINDOWS)
- WHEN U ALREADY HAS .NET CORE RUNTIME/SDK, OR WANTS 2 INSTALL AN USE WAN
- WHEN U WANTS 2 MINIMIZE ASF STRUCCHUR SIZE BY HANDLIN RUNTIME REQUIREMENTS YOURSELF
- When you want to use a custom **[plugin](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Plugins)** which requires a generic setup of ASF to run properly (due to missing native dependencies)

HOWEVR, KEEP IN MIND DAT URE IN CHARGE OV .NET CORE RUNTIME IN DIS CASE. DIS MEANZ DAT IF UR .NET CORE SDK (RUNTIME) IZ UNAVAILABLE, OUTDATD OR BROKD, ASF WONT WERK. DIS AR TEH Y WE DOAN RECOMMEND DIS SETUP 4 CASUAL USERS, SINCE U NAO NED 2 ENSURE DAT UR .NET CORE SDK (RUNTIME) MATCHEZ ASF REQUIREMENTS AN CAN RUN ASF, AS OPPOSD 2 **US** ENSURIN DAT R .NET CORE RUNTIME BUNDLD WIF ASF CAN DO SO.

4 GENERIC PACKAGE, U CAN FOLLOW ENTIRE OS-SPECIFIC GUIDE ABOOV, WIF 2 SMALL CHANGEZ. IN ADDISHUN 2 INSTALLIN .NET CORE PREREQUIZIETS, U ALSO WANTS 2 INSTALL .NET CORE SDK, AN INSTEAD OV HAVIN OS-SPECIFIC `ARCHISTEAMFARM(.EXE)` EXECUTABLE FILE, U NAO HAS GENERIC `ARCHISTEAMFARM.DLL` BINARY ONLY. EVRYTHIN ELSE IZ EGSAKTLY TEH SAME.

WIF EXTRA STEPS:

- Install **[.NET Core prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/install/dependencies?tabs=netcore31)**.
- Install **[.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download)** (or at least runtime) appropriate for your OS. You most likely want to use an installer. Refer to **[runtime requirements](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Compatibility#runtime-requirements)** if you're not sure which version to install.
- Download **[latest ASF release](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/releases/latest)** in generic variant.
- Extract the archive into new location (and `chmod +x ArchiSteamFarm.sh` if you're on Linux/OS X).
- **[Configure ASF](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration)**.
- LAUNCH ASF BY EITHR USIN HELPR SCRIPT OR EXECUTIN `DOTNET /PATH/2/ARCHISTEAMFARM.DLL` MANUALLY FRUM UR FAVOURITE SHELL.

HELPR SCRIPTS (SUCH AS `ARCHISTEAMFARM.CMD` 4 WINDOWS AN `ARCHISTEAMFARM.SH` 4 LINUX/OS X) R LOCATD NEXT 2 `ARCHISTEAMFARM.DLL` BINARY - DOSE R INCLUDD IN GENERIC VARIANT ONLY. U CAN USE THEM IF U DOAN WANTS 2 EXECUTE `DOTNET` COMMAND MANUALLY. OBVIOUSLY HELPR SCRIPTS WONT WERK IF U DIDNT INSTALL .NET CORE SDK AN U DOAN HAS `DOTNET` EXECUTABLE AVAILABLE IN UR `PATH`. HELPR SCRIPTS R ENTIRELY OPSHUNAL 2 USE, U CAN ALWAYS `DOTNET /PATH/2/ARCHISTEAMFARM.DLL` MANUALLY.
