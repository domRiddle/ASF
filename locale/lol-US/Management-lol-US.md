# Management

This section covers subjects related to managing the ASF process in optimal way. While not strictly mandatory for usage, it includes bunch of tips, tricks and good practices that we'd like to share, especially for system administrators, people packaging the ASF for usage in third-party repositories, as well as advanced users and alike.

## `systemd` service for Linux

In `generic` and `linux` variants, ASF comes with `ArchiSteamFarm@.service` file, which is a configuration file of the service for **[`systemd`](https://systemd.io)**. If you'd like to run ASF as a service, for example in order to launch it automatically after startup of your machine, then a proper `systemd` service is arguably the best way to do it, therefore we highly recommend it instead of managing it on your own through `nohup`, `screen` or alike.

Firstly, create the account for the user you want to run ASF under, assuming it doesn't exist yet. We'll use `asf` user for this example, if you decided to use a different one, you'll need to substitute `asf` user in all of our examples below with your selected one. Our service does not allow you to run ASF as `root`, since it's considered a **[bad practice](#never-run-asf-as-administrator)**.

```sh
su # or sudo -i
adduser asf
```

Next, unpack ASF to `/home/asf/ArchiSteamFarm` folder. The folder structure is important for our service unit, it should be `ArchiSteamFarm` folder in your `$HOME`, so `/home/<user>`. If you did everything correctly, there will be `/home/asf/ArchiSteamFarm/ArchiSteamFarm@.service` file existing.

We'll do all below actions as `root`, so get to its shell with `su` or `sudo -i`.

Firstly it's a good idea to ensure that our folder still belongs to our `asf` user, `chown -hR asf:asf /home/asf/ArchiSteamFarm` executed once will do it. The permissions could be wrong e.g. if you've downloaded and/or unpacked the zip file as `root`.

Next, `cd /etc/systemd/system` and execute `ln -s /home/asf/ArchiSteamFarm/ArchiSteamFarm\@.service .`, this will create a symbolic link to our service declaration and register it in `systemd`.

Afterwards, ensure that `systemd` recognizes our service:

```
systemctl status ArchiSteamFarm@asf

○ ArchiSteamFarm@asf.service - ArchiSteamFarm Service (on asf)
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/ArchiSteamFarm@.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: inactive (dead)
       Docs: https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki
```

Pay special attention to the user we declare after `@`, it's `asf` in our case. Our systemd service unit expects from you to declare the user, as it influences the exact place of the binary `/home/<user>/ArchiSteamFarm`, as well as the actual user systemd will spawn the process as.

If systemd returned output similar to above, everything is in order, and we're almost done. Now all that is left is actually starting our service as our chosen user: `systemctl start ArchiSteamFarm@asf`. Wait a second or two, and you can check the status again:

```
systemctl status ArchiSteamFarm@asf

● ArchiSteamFarm@asf.service - ArchiSteamFarm Service (on asf)
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/ArchiSteamFarm@.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since (...)
       Docs: https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki
   Main PID: (...)
(...)
```

If `systemd` states `active (running)`, it means everything went well, and you can verify that ASF process should be up and running, for example with `tail -f -n 100 /var/log/syslog`, as ASF by default also reports its console output to syslog. If you're satisfied with the setup you have right now, you can tell `systemd` to automatically start your service during boot, by executing `systemctl enable ArchiSteamFarm@asf` command. That's all.

If by any chance you'd like to stop the process, simply execute `systemctl stop ArchiSteamFarm@asf`. Likewise, if you want to disable ASF from being started automatically on boot, `systemctl disable ArchiSteamFarm@asf` will do that for you, it's very simple.

Please note that, as there is no standard input enabled for our `systemd` service, you won't be able to input your details through the console in usual way. Running through `systemd` is equivalent to specifying **[`Headless: true`](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration#headless)** setting and comes with all its implications. Fortunately for you, it's very easy to manage your ASF through **[ASF-ui](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/IPC#asf-ui)**, which we recommend in case you need to supply additional details during login or otherwise manage your ASF process further.

### Environment variables

It's possible to supply additional environment variables to our `systemd` service, which you'll be interested in doing in case you want to for example use a custom `--cryptkey` **[command-line argument](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Command-line-arguments#arguments)**, therefore specifying `ASF_CRYPTKEY` environment variable.

In order to provide custom environment variables, create `/etc/asf` folder (in case it doesn't exist), `mkdir -p /etc/asf`, then write to a `/etc/asf/<user>` file, where `<user>` is the user you're running the service under (`asf` in our example above, so `/etc/asf/asf`).

The file should contain all environment variables that you'd like to provide to the process:

```sh
# Declare only those that you actually need
ASF_CRYPTKEY="my_super_important_secret_cryptkey"
ASF_NETWORK_GROUP="my_network_group"

# And any other ones you're interested in
```

## Never run ASF as administrator!

ASF includes its own validation whether the process is being run as administrator (`root`) or not. Running as root is **not** required for any kind of operation done by the ASF process, assuming properly configured environment it's operating in, and therefore should be regarded as a **bad practice**. This means that on Windows, ASF should never be executed with "run as administrator" setting, and on Unix ASF should have a dedicated user account for itself, or re-use your own in case of a desktop system.

For further elaboration on *why* we discourage running ASF as root, refer to **[superuser](https://superuser.com/questions/218379/why-is-it-bad-to-run-as-root)** and other resources. If you're still not convinced, ask yourself what would happen to your machine if ASF process executed `rm -rf --no-preserve-root /` command right after its launch.

### I run as `root` because ASF can't write to its files

This means that you have wrongly configured permissions of the files ASF is trying to access. You should login as `root` account (either with `su` or `sudo -i`) and then **correct** the permissions by issuing `chown -hR asf:asf /path/to/ASF` command, substituting `asf:asf` with the user that you'll run ASF under, and `/path/to/ASF` accordingly. If by any chance you're using custom `--path` telling ASF user to use the different directory, you should execute the same command again for that path as well.

After doing that, you should no longer get any kind of issue related to ASF not being able to write over its own files, as you've just changed the owner of everything ASF is interested in to the user the ASF process will actually run under.

### I run as `root` because I don't know how to do it otherwise

```sh
su # or sudo -i
adduser asf
chown -hR asf:asf /path/to/ASF
su asf -c /path/to/ASF/ArchiSteamFarm # or sudo -u asf /path/to/ASF/ArchiSteamFarm
```

That would be doing it manually, it's much easier to use our **[`systemd` service](#systemd-service-for-linux)** explained above.

## MULTIPLE INSTANCEZ

ASF IZ COMPATIBLE WIF RUNNIN MULTIPLE INSTANCEZ OV TEH PROCES ON TEH SAME MACHINE. TEH INSTANCEZ CAN BE COMPLETELY STANDALONE OR DERIVD FRUM TEH SAME BINARY LOCASHUN (IN WHICH CASE, U WANTS 2 RUN THEM WIF DIFFERENT `--path` **[COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENT](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Command-line-arguments-lol-US)**).

WHEN RUNNIN MULTIPLE INSTANCEZ FRUM TEH SAME BINARY, KEEP IN MIND DAT U SHUD TYPICALLY DISABLE AUTO-UPDATEZ IN ALL OV THEIR CONFIGS, AS THAR IZ NO SYNCHRONIZASHUN TWEEN THEM IN REGARDZ 2 AUTO-UPDATEZ. IF UD LIEK 2 KEEP HAVIN AUTO-UPDATEZ ENABLD, WE RECOMMEND STANDALONE INSTANCEZ, BUT U CAN STILL MAK UPDATEZ WERK, AS LONG AS U CAN ENSURE DAT ALL OTHR ASF INSTANCEZ R CLOSD.

ASF WILL DO ITZ BEST 2 MAINTAIN MINIMUM AMOUNT OV OS-WIDE, CROS-PROCES COMMUNICASHUN WIF OTHR ASF INSTANCEZ. DIS INCLUDEZ ASF CHECKIN ITZ CONFIGURASHUN DIRECTORY AGAINST OTHR INSTANCEZ, AS WELL AS SHARIN CORE PROCES-WIDE LIMITERS CONFIGURD WIF `*LimiterDelay` **[GLOBAL CONFIG PROPERTIEZ](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration-lol-US#global-config)**, ENSURIN DAT RUNNIN MULTIPLE ASF INSTANCEZ WILL NOT CAUSE POSIBILITY 2 RUN INTO RATE-LIMITIN ISSUE. IN REGARDZ 2 TECHNICAL ASPECTS, ALL PLATFORMS USE R DEDICATD MECHANISM OV CUSTOM ASF FILE-BASD LOCKZ CREATD IN TEMPORARY DIRECTORY, WHICH IZ `C:\Users\<YourUser>\AppData\Local\Temp\ASF` ON WINDOWS, AN `/tmp/ASF` ON UNIX.

IZ NOT REQUIRD 4 RUNNIN ASF INSTANCEZ 2 SHARE TEH SAME `*LimiterDelay` PROPERTIEZ, THEY CAN USE DIFFERENT VALUEZ, AS EACH ASF WILL ADD ITZ OWN CONFIGURD DELAY 2 TEH RELEASE TIEM AFTR ACQUIRIN TEH LOCK. IF TEH CONFIGURD `*LimiterDelay` IZ SET 2 `0`, ASF INSTANCE WILL ENTIRELY SKIP WAITIN 4 DA LOCK OV GIVEN RESOURCE DAT IZ SHARD WIF OTHR INSTANCEZ (DAT CUD POTENTIALLY STILL MAINTAIN SHARD LOCK WIF EACH OTHR). WHEN SET 2 ANY OTHR VALUE, ASF WILL PROPERLY SYNCHRONIZE WIF OTHR ASF INSTANCEZ AN WAIT 4 ITZ TURN, DEN RELEASE TEH LOCK AFTR CONFIGURD DELAY, ALLOWIN OTHR INSTANCEZ 2 CONTINUE.

ASF TAKEZ INTO AKOWNT `WebProxy` SETTIN WHEN DECIDIN BOUT SHARD SCOPE, WHICH MEANZ DAT 2 ASF INSTANCEZ USIN DIFFERENT `WebProxy` CONFIGURASHUNS WILL NOT SHARE THEIR LIMITERS WIF EACH OTHR. DIS AR TEH IMPLEMENTD IN ORDR 2 ALLOW `WebProxy` SETUPS 2 OPERATE WITHOUT EXCESIV DELAYS, AS EXPECTD FRUM DIFFERENT NETWORK INTERFACEZ.

ROUTIN REQUESTS YOURSELF IN DIFFERENT WAI, U CAN SPECIFY NETWORK GROUP YOURSELF THRU `--network-group` **[COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENT](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Command-line-arguments-lol-US)**, WHICH WILL ALLOW U 2 DECLARE ASF GROUP DAT WILL BE SYNCHRONIZD WIF DIS INSTANCE. KEEP IN MIND DAT CUSTOM NETWORK GROUPS R USD EXCLUSIVELY, WHICH MEANZ DAT ASF WILL NO LONGR USE `WebProxy` 4 DETERMININ TEH RITE GROUP, AS URE IN CHARGE OV GROUPIN IN DIS CASE.
