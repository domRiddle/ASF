# ASF LOGIC

REGARDLES IF U USE ASF 2FA OR NOT, ASF INCLUDEZ PROPR LOGIC AN IZ FULLY AWARE OV ACCOUNTS PROTECTD BY STANDARD 2FA. IT WILL ASK U 4 REQUIRD DETAILS WHEN THEYRE NEEDD (SUCH AS DURIN LOGGIN IN). HOWEVR, DOSE REQUESTS CAN BE AUTOMATD BY USIN ASF 2FA, WHICH WILL AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE REQUIRD TOKENS, SAVIN U HASLE AN ENABLIN EXTRA FUNCSHUNALITY (DESCRIBD BELOW).

# ASF 2FA

ASF 2FA IZ BUILT-IN MODULE RESPONSIBLE 4 PROVIDIN 2FA FEATUREZ 2 TEH ASF PROCES, SUCH AS GENERATIN TOKENS AN ACCEPTIN CONFIRMASHUNS. IT WERKZ BY DUPLICATIN UR EXISTIN AUTHENTICATOR DETAILS, SO DAT U CAN USE UR CURRENT AUTHENTICATOR AN ASF 2FA AT TEH SAME TIEM.

U CAN VERIFY WHETHR UR BOT AKOWNT IZ USIN ASF 2FA ALREADY BY EXECUTIN `2fa` **[COMMANDZ](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands-lol-US)**. UNLES UVE ALREADY IMPORTD UR AUTHENTICATOR AS ASF 2FA, ALL STANDARD `2fa` COMMANDZ WILL BE NON-OPERATIV, WHICH MEANZ DAT UR AKOWNT IZ NOT USIN ASF 2FA, THEREFORE IZ ALSO UNAVAILABLE 4 ADVANCD ASF FEATUREZ DAT REQUIRE TEH MODULE 2 BE OPERATIV.

# Recommendations

There are a lot of ways to make ASF 2FA operative, here we include our recommendations based on your current situation:

- If you're already using SteamDesktopAuthenticator, WinAuth or any other third-party app that allows you to extract 2FA details with ease, just **[import](#import)** those to ASF.
- If you're using official app and you don't mind resetting your 2FA credentials, the best way is to disable 2FA, then **[create](#creation)** new 2FA credentials by using **[joint authenticator](#joint-authenticator)**, which will allow you to use official app and ASF 2FA. This method doesn't require root or advanced knowledge, barely following instructions.
- If you're using official app and don't want to recreate your 2FA credentials, your options are very limited, typically you'll need root and extra fiddling around to **[import](#import)** those details, and even with that it might be impossible.
- If you're not using 2FA yet and don't care, you can use ASF 2FA with **[standalone authenticator](#standalone-authenticator)**, third-party app **[duplicating](#import)** to ASF, or **[joint authenticator](#joint-authenticator)** with official app.

Below we discuss all possible options and known to us methods.

---

## CREASHUN

In general, we strongly recommend **[duplicating](#import)** your existing authenticator, since that's the main purpose ASF 2FA was designed for. However, ASF comes with an official `MobileAuthenticator` **[plugin](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Plugins)** that further extends ASF 2FA, allowing you to link a completely new authenticator as well. This can be useful in case you're unable or unwilling to use other tools and do not mind ASF 2FA becoming your main (and maybe only) authenticator.

There are two possible scenarios for adding a two-factor authenticator with the `MobileAuthenticator` **[plugin](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Plugins)**: standalone or joint with the official Steam mobile app. In the second scenario, you will end up with the same authenticator on both the ASF and mobile app; both will generate the same codes, and both will be able to confirm trade offers, Steam Community Market transactions, etc.

### Common steps for both scenarios

No matter if you plan to use ASF as the standalone authenticator or want the same authenticator on the official Steam mobile app, you need to do those initialization steps:

1. Create an ASF bot for the target account, start it, and log in, which you probably already did.
2. Assign a working and operational phone number to the account **[here](https://store.steampowered.com/phone/manage)** to be used by the bot. A phone number is absolutely required, as there is no way to add 2FA without it.
3. Ensure you're not using 2FA yet for your account, if you do, disable it first.
4. Execute the `2fainit [Bot]` command, replacing `[Bot]` with your bot's name.

ASSUMIN U GOT SUCCESFUL REPLY, TEH FOLLOWIN 2 THINGS HAS HAPPEND:

- A NEW `<Bot>.maFile.PENDING` FILE WUZ GENERATD BY ASF IN UR `config` DIRECTORY.
- SMS WUZ SENT FRUM STEAM 2 TEH FONE NUMBR U HAS ASSIGND 4 DA AKOWNT ABOOV.

The authenticator details are not operational yet, however, you can review the generated file if you'd like to. If you want to be double safe, you can, for example, already write down the revocation code. The next steps will depend on your selected scenario.

### Standalone authenticator

If you want to use ASF as your main (or even only) authenticator, now you need to do the finalization step:

5. Execute the `2fafinalize [Bot] <ActivationCode>` command, replacing `[Bot]` with your bot's name and `<ActivationCode>` with the code you've received through SMS in the previous step.

### Joint authenticator

If you want to have the same authenticator in both ASF and the official Steam mobile app, now you need to do the next steps:

5. Ignore the SMS that you received after the previous step.
6. Install the Steam mobile app if it's not installed yet, and open it. Navigate to the Steam Guard tab and add a new authenticator by following the app's instructions.
7. After your authenticator in the mobile app is added and working, return to ASF. You now need to tell ASF that finalization is done with the help of one of the two commands below:
 - Wait until the next 2fa code is shown in the Steam mobile app, and use the command `2fafinalized [Bot] <2fa_code_from_app>` replacing `[Bot]` with your bot's name and `<2fa_code_from_app>` with the code you currently see in the Steam mobile app. If the code generated by ASF and the code you provided are the same, ASF assumes that an authenticator was added correctly and proceeds with importing your newly created authenticator.
 - We strongly recommend to do the above in order to ensure that your credentials are valid. However, if you don't want to (or can't) check if codes are the same and you know what you're doing, you can instead use the command `2fafinalizedforce [Bot]`, replacing `[Bot]` with your bot's name. ASF will assume that the authenticator was added correctly and proceed with importing your newly created authenticator.

### After finalization

Assuming everything worked properly, the previously generated `<Bot>.maFile.PENDING` file was renamed to `<Bot>.maFile.NEW`. DIS INDICATEZ DAT UR 2FA CREDENTIALS R NAO VALID AN ACTIV. We recommend that you create a copy of that file and keep it in **a secure and safe location**. In addition to that, we recommend you open the file in your editor of choice and write down the `revocation_code`, which will allow you to, as the name implies, revoke the authenticator in case you lose it.

In regard to technical details, the generated `maFile` includes all details that we have received from the Steam server during linking the authenticator, and in addition to that, the `device_id` field, which may be needed for other authenticators. The file is fully compatible with **[SDA](#steamdesktopauthenticator)** for import.

ASF automatically imports your authenticator once the procedure is done, and therefore `2fa` and other related commands should now be operational for the bot account you linked the authenticator to.

## IMPORT

IMPORT PROCES REQUIREZ ALREADY LINKD AN OPERASHUNAL AUTHENTICATOR DAT IZ SUPPORTD BY ASF. ASF CURRENTLY SUPPORTS FEW DIFFERENT OFFISHUL AN UNOFFISHUL SOURCEZ OV 2FA - ANDROID, IOS, STEAMDESKTOPAUTHENTICATOR AN WINAUTH, ON TOP OV MANUAL METHOD WHICH ALLOWS U 2 PROVIDE REQUIRD CREDENTIALS YOURSELF. IF U DOAN HAS ANY AUTHENTICATOR YET, U NED 2 CHOOSE WAN OV AVAILABLE APPS AN SET IT UP FIRSTLY. IF U DOAN KNOE BETTR WHICH WAN 2 PICK, WE RECOMMEND WINAUTH, BUT ANY OV TEH ABOOV WILL WERK FINE ASSUMIN U FOLLOW TEH INSTRUCSHUNS.

ALL FOLLOWIN GUIDEZ REQUIRE FRUM U 2 ALREADY HAS **WERKIN AN OPERASHUNAL** AUTHENTICATOR BEAN USD WIF GIVEN TOOL/APPLICASHUN. ASF 2FA WILL NOT OPERATE PROPERLY IF U IMPORT INVALID DATA, THEREFORE MAK SURE DAT UR AUTHENTICATOR WERKZ PROPERLY BEFORE ATTEMPTIN 2 IMPORT IT. DIS DOEZ INCLUDE TESTIN AN VERIFYIN DAT FOLLOWIN AUTHENTICATOR FUNCSHUNS WERK PROPERLY:
- U CAN GENERATE TOKENS AN DOSE TOKENS R ACCEPTD BY STEAM NETWORK
- U CAN FETCH CONFIRMASHUNS, AN THEY R ARRIVIN ON UR MOBILE AUTHENTICATOR
- U CAN ACCEPT DOSE CONFIRMASHUNS, AN THEYRE PROPERLY RECOGNIZD BY STEAM NETWORK AS CONFIRMD/REJECTD

ENSURE DAT UR AUTHENTICATOR WERKZ BY CHECKIN IF ABOOV ACSHUNS WERK - IF THEY DOAN, DEN THEY WONT WERK IN ASF EITHR, ULL ONLY WASTE TIEM AN CAUSE YOURSELF ADDISHUNAL TROUBLE.

### ANDROID FONE

**The below instructions apply to Steam app in version `2.X`, there are currently limited **[resources](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/discussions/2786)** on extracting required details from version `3.0` onwards. WELL UPDATE DIS SECSHUN ONCE GENERALLY-AVAILABLE METHOD IZ FINDZ. AS OV TODAI, WERKAROUND WUD BE 2 INTENSHUNALLY INSTALL OLDR VERSHUN OV STEAM APP, REGISTR 2FA AN EXTRACT TEH REQUIRD DETAILS FURST, AFTR WHICH IZ POSIBLE 2 UPDATE TEH APPLICASHUN 2 LATEST VERSHUN - EXISTIN AUTHENTICATOR WILL CONTINUE 2 WERK.**

IN GENERAL 4 IMPORTIN AUTHENTICATOR FRUM UR ANDROID FONE U WILL NED  **[ROOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooting_(Android_OS))** ACCES. ROOTIN VARIEZ FRUM DEVICE 2 DEVICE, SO I WONT TELL U HOW 2 ROOT UR DEVICE. VISIT **[XDA](https://www.xda-developers.com/root)** 4 AWSUM GUIDEZ ON HOW 2 DO DAT, AS WELL AS GENERAL INFORMASHUN ON ROOTIN IN GENERAL. IF U CANT FIND UR DEVICE OR TEH GUIDE DAT U NED, TRY 2 FIND IT ON GOOGLE SECOND.

AT LEAST OFFICIALLY, IZ NOT POSIBLE 2 ACCES PROTECTD STEAM FILEZ WITHOUT ROOT. TEH ONLY OFFISHUL NON-ROOT METHOD 4 EXTRACTIN STEAM FILEZ IZ CREATIN UNENCRYPTD `/data` BAKUP IN WAN WAI OR ANOTHR AN MANUALLY FETCHIN APPROPRIATE FILEZ FRUM IT ON UR PC, HOWEVR CUZ SUCH TING HIGHLY DEPENDZ ON UR FONE MANUFACTURR AN **IZ NOT** IN ANDROID STANDARD, WE WONT DISCUS IT HER. IF URE LUCKY 2 HAS SUCH FUNCSHUNALITY, U CAN MAK USE OV IT, BUT MAJORITY OV USERS DOAN HAS ANYTHIN LIEK DAT.

UNOFFICIALLY, IT POSIBLE 2 EXTRACT TEH NEEDD FILEZ WITHOUT ROOT ACCES, BY INSTALLIN OR DOWNGRADIN UR STEAM APP 2 VERSHUN `2.1` (OR EARLIR), SETTIN UP MOBILE AUTHENTICATOR AN DEN CREATIN SNAPSHOT OV TEH APP (TOGETHR WIF TEH `data` FILEZ DAT WE NED) THRU `adb backup`. HOWEVR, SINCE IT BE SERIOUS SECURITY BREACH AN ENTIRELY UNSUPPORTD WAI 2 EXTRACT TEH FILEZ, WE WONT ELABORATE FURTHR ON DIS, VALVE DISABLD DIS SECURITY HOLE IN NEWR VERSHUNS 4 REASON, AN WE ONLY MENSHUN IT AS POSIBILITY. STILL, IT MITE BE POSIBLE 2 DO CLEAN INSTALL OV DAT VERSHUN, LINK NEW AUTHENTICATOR, EXTRACT TEH REQUIRD FILEZ, AN DEN UPGRADE TEH APP, WHICH SHUD BE JUS ENOUGH, BUT URE ON UR OWN WIF DIS METHOD ANYWAY.

ASSUMIN DAT UVE SUCCESFULLY ROOTD UR FONE, U SHUD AFTERWARDZ DOWNLOAD ANY ROOT EXPLORR AVAILABLE ON TEH MARKIT, SUCH AS **[DIS WAN](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jrummy.root.browserfree)** (OR ANY OTHR WAN OV UR PREFERENCE). U CAN ALSO ACCES TEH PROTECTD FILEZ THRU ADB (ANDROID DEBUG BRIDGE) OR ANY OTHR AVAILABLE 2 U METHOD, WELL DO IT THRU TEH EXPLORR SINCE IZ DEFINITELY TEH MOST USR-FRIENDLY WAI.

ONCE U OPEND UR ROOT EXPLORR, NAVIGATE 2 `/data/data` FOLDR. KEEP IN MIND DAT `/data/data` DIRECTORY IZ PROTECTD AN U WONT BE ABLE 2 ACCES IT WITHOUT ROOT ACCES. ONCE THAR, FIND `com.valvesoftware.android.steam.community` FOLDR AN COPY IT 2 UR `/sdcard`, WHICH POINTS 2 UR BUILT-IN INTERNAL STORAGE. AFTERWARDZ, U SHUD BE ABLE 2 PLUG UR FONE 2 UR PC AN COPY TEH FOLDR FRUM UR INTERNAL STORAGE LIEK USUAL. IF BY ANY CHANCE TEH FOLDR WONT BE VISIBLE DESPITE U BEAN SURE DAT U COPID IT 2 TEH RITE PLACE, TRY RESTARTIN UR FONE FURST.

NAO, U CAN CHOOSE IF U WANTS 2 IMPORT UR AUTHENTICATOR 2 WINAUTH FURST, DEN 2 ASF, OR 2 ASF RITE AWAY. FURST OPSHUN IZ MOAR FRIENDLY AN ALLOWS U 2 DUPLICATE UR AUTHENTICATOR ALSO ON UR PC, ALLOWIN U 2 MAK CONFIRMASHUNS AN GENERATE TOKENS FRUM 3 DIFFERENT PLACEZ - UR FONE, UR PC AN ASF. IF U WANTS 2 DO DAT, SIMPLY OPEN WINAUTH, ADD NEW STEAM AUTHENTICATOR AN CHOOSE IMPORTIN FRUM ANDROID OPSHUN, DEN FOLLOW INSTRUCSHUNS BY ACCESIN TEH FILEZ DAT UVE OBTAIND ABOOV. WHEN DUN, U CAN DEN IMPORT DIS AUTHENTICATOR FRUM WINAUTH 2 ASF, WHICH IZ EXPLAIND IN DEDICATD WINAUTH SECSHUN BELOW.

IF U DOAN WANTS 2 OR DOAN NED 2 GO THRU WINAUTH, DEN SIMPLY COPY `files/Steamguard-<SteamID>` FILE FRUM R PROTECTD DIRECTORY, WER `SteamID` IZ UR 64-BIT STEAM IDENTIFICATOR OV TEH AKOWNT DAT U WANTS 2 ADD (IF MOAR THAN WAN, CUZ IF U HAS ONLY WAN AKOWNT DEN DIS WILL BE TEH ONLY FILE). U NED 2 PLACE DAT FILE IN ASFS `config` DIRECTORY. ONCE U DO DAT, RENAME TEH FILE 2 `BotName.maFile`, WER `BotName` IZ TEH NAYM OV UR BOT URE ADDIN ASF 2FA 2. AFTR DIS STEP, LAUNCH ASF - IT SHUD NOTICE TEH `.maFile` AN IMPORT IT.

```text
[*] INFO: ImportAuthenticator() <1> Converting .maFile into ASF format...
[*] INFO: ImportAuthenticator() <1> Successfully finished importing mobile authenticator!
```

THAZ ALL, ASSUMIN DAT UVE IMPORTD TEH CORRECT FILE WIF VALID SECRETS, EVRYTHIN SHUD WERK PROPERLY, WHICH U CAN VERIFY BY USIN `2fa` COMMANDZ. IF U MADE MISTAEK, U CAN ALWAYS REMOOV `Bot.db` AN START OVAR IF NEEDD.

### IOS

4 IOS U CAN USE **[IOS-STEAMGUARD-EXTRACTOR](https://github.com/CaitSith2/ios-steamguard-extractor)**. DIS AR TEH POSIBLE THX 2 TEH FACT DAT U CAN MAK DECRYPTD BAKUP, PUT IN ON UR PC AN USE TEH TOOL IN ORDR 2 EXTRACT STEAM DATA DAT IZ OTHERWIZE IMPOSIBLE 2 GIT (AT LEAST WITHOUT JAILBREAK, DUE 2 IOS ENCRYPSHUN).

HEAD OVAR 2 **[LATEST RELEASE](https://github.com/CaitSith2/ios-steamguard-extractor/releases/latest)** IN ORDR 2 DOWNLOAD TEH PROGRAM. ONCE U EXTRACT TEH DATA U CAN PUT IT E.G. IN WINAUTH, DEN FRUM WINAUTH 2 ASF (ALTHOUGH U CAN ALSO SIMPLY COPY GENERATD JSON STARTIN FRUM `{` ENDIN ON `}` INTO `BotName.maFile` AN PROCED LIEK USUAL). IF U ASK ME, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND 2 IMPORT 2 WINAUTH FURST, DEN MAKIN SURE DAT BOTH GENERATIN TOKENS AS WELL AS ACCEPTIN CONFIRMASHUNS WERK PROPERLY, SO U CAN BE SURE DAT EVRYTHIN IZ ALRIGHT. IF UR CREDENTIALS R INVALID, ASF 2FA WILL NOT WERK PROPERLY, SO IZ MUTCH BETTR 2 MAK ASF IMPORT STEP UR LAST WAN.

4 QUESHUNS/ISSUEZ, PLZ VISIT  **[ISSUEZ](https://github.com/CaitSith2/ios-steamguard-extractor/issues)**.

*KEEP IN MIND DAT ABOOV TOOL IZ UNOFFISHUL, URE USIN IT AT UR OWN RISK. WE DO NOT OFFR TECHNICAL SUPPORT IF IT DOESNT WERK PROPERLY - WE GOT FEW SIGNALS DAT IZ EXPORTIN INVALID 2FA CREDENTIALS - VERIFY DAT CONFIRMASHUNS WERK IN AUTHENTICATOR LIEK WINAUTH PRIOR 2 IMPORTIN DAT DATA 2 ASF!*

### STEAMDESKTOPAUTHENTICATOR

IF U HAS UR AUTHENTICATOR RUNNIN IN SDA ALREADY, U SHUD NOTICE DAT THAR IZ `steamID.maFile` FILE AVAILABLE IN `maFiles` FOLDR. MAK SURE DAT `maFile` IZ IN UNENCRYPTD FORM, AS ASF CANT DECRYPT SDA FILEZ - UNENCRYPTD FILE CONTENT SHUD START WIF `{` AN END WIF `}` CHARACTR. IF NEEDD, U CAN REMOOV TEH ENCRYPSHUN FRUM SDA SETTINGS FURST, AN ENABLE IT AGAIN WHEN URE DUN. ONCE TEH FILE IZ IN UNENCRYPTD FORM, COPY IT 2 `config` DIRECTORY OV ASF.

U CAN NAO RENAME `steamID.maFile` 2 `BotName.maFile` IN ASF CONFIG DIRECTORY, WER `BotName` IZ TEH NAYM OV UR BOT URE ADDIN ASF 2FA 2. ALTERNATIVELY U CAN LEEF IT AS IT IZ, ASF WILL DEN PICK IT AUTOMATICALLY AFTR LOGGIN IN. RENAMIN TEH FILE HELPS ASF BY MAKIN IT POSIBLE 2 USE ASF 2FA BEFORE LOGGIN IN, IF U DOAN DO DAT, DEN TEH FILE CAN BE PICKD ONLY AFTR ASF SUCCESFULLY LOGS IN (AS ASF DOESNT KNOE `steamID` OV UR AKOWNT BEFORE IN FACT LOGGIN IN).

IF U DID EVRYTHIN RITE, LAUNCH ASF, AN U SHUD NOTICE:

```text
[*] INFO: ImportAuthenticator() <1> Converting .maFile into ASF format...
[*] INFO: ImportAuthenticator() <1> Successfully finished importing mobile authenticator!
```

FRUM NAO ON, UR ASF 2FA SHUD BE OPERASHUNAL 4 DIS AKOWNT.

---

### WINAUTH

FIRSTLY CREATE NEW EMPTY `BotName.maFile` IN ASF CONFIG DIRECTORY, WER `BotName` IZ TEH NAYM OV UR BOT URE ADDIN ASF 2FA 2. REMEMBR DAT IT SHUD BE `BotName.maFile` AN NOT `BotName.maFile.txt`, WINDOWS LIKEZ 2 HIDE KNOWN EXTENSHUNS BY DEFAULT. IF U PROVIDE INCORRECT NAYM, IT WONT BE PICKD BY ASF.

NAO LAUNCH WINAUTH AS USUAL. RITE CLICK ON STEAM ICON AN SELECT "SHOW STEAMGUARD AN RECOVERY CODE". DEN CHECK "ALLOW COPY". U SHUD NOTICE FAMILIAR 2 U JSON STRUCCHUR ON TEH BOTTOM OV TEH WINDOW, STARTIN WIF `{`. COPY WHOLE TEXT INTO `BotName.maFile` FILE CREATD BY U IN PREVIOUS STEP.

IF U DID EVRYTHIN RITE, LAUNCH ASF, AN U SHUD NOTICE:

```text
[*] INFO: ImportAuthenticator() <1> Converting .maFile into ASF format...
[*] INFO: ImportAuthenticator() <1> Successfully finished importing mobile authenticator!
```

FRUM NAO ON, UR ASF 2FA SHUD BE OPERASHUNAL 4 DIS AKOWNT.

---

## DUN

FRUM DIS MOMENT, ALL `2fa` COMMANDZ WILL WERK AS THEYD BE CALLD ON UR CLASIC 2FA DEVICE. U CAN USE BOTH ASF 2FA AN UR AUTHENTICATOR OV CHOICE (ANDROID, IOS, SDA OR WINAUTH) 2 GENERATE TOKENS AN ACCEPT CONFIRMASHUNS.

IF U HAS AUTHENTICATOR ON UR FONE, U CAN OPSHUNALLY REMOOV STEAMDESKTOPAUTHENTICATOR AN/OR WINAUTH, AS WE WONT NED IT NOMORE. HOWEVR, I SUGGEST 2 KEEP IT JUS IN CASE, NOT 2 MENSHUN DAT IZ MOAR HANDY THAN NORMAL STEAM AUTHENTICATOR. JUS KEEP IN MIND DAT ASF 2FA IZ **NOT** GENERAL PURPOSE AUTHENTICATOR, IT DOESNT INCLUDE ALL DATA DAT AUTHENTICATOR SHUD HAS, BUT LIMITD SUBSET OV ORIGINAL `maFile`. IZ NOT POSIBLE 2 CONVERT ASF 2FA BAK 2 ORIGINAL AUTHENTICATOR, THEREFORE ALWAYS MAK SURE DAT U HAS GENERAL-PURPOSE AUTHENTICATOR OR `maFile` IN OTHR PLACE, SUCH AS IN WINAUTH/SDA, OR ON UR FONE.

## FAQ

### HOW IZ ASF MAKIN USE OV 2FA MODULE?

IF ASF 2FA IZ AVAILABLE, ASF WILL USE IT 4 AUTOMATIC CONFIRMASHUN OV TRADEZ DAT R BEAN SENT/ACCEPTD BY ASF. IT WILL ALSO BE CAPABLE OV AUTOMATICALLY GENERATIN 2FA TOKENS ON AS-NEEDD BASIS, 4 EXAMPLE IN ORDR 2 LOG IN. IN ADDISHUN 2 DAT, HAVIN ASF 2FA ALSO ENABLEZ `2fa` COMMANDZ 4 U 2 USE. DAT SHUD BE ALL 4 NAO, IF I DIDNT FORGET BOUT ANYTHIN - BASICALLY ASF USEZ 2FA MODULE ON AS-NEEDD BASIS.

---

### WUT IF NEEDZ 2FA TOKEN?

U WILL NED 2FA TOKEN 2 ACCES 2FA-PROTECTD AKOWNT, DAT INCLUDEZ EVRY AKOWNT WIF ASF 2FA AS WELL. U SHUD GENERATE TOKENS IN AUTHENTICATOR DAT U USD 4 IMPORT, BUT U CAN ALSO GENERATE TEMPORARY TOKENS THRU `2fa` COMMAND SENT VIA TEH CHAT 2 GIVEN BOT. U CAN ALSO USE `2fa <BotNames>` COMMAND 2 GENERATE TEMPORARY TOKEN 4 GIVEN BOT INSTANCEZ. DIS SHUD BE ENOUGH 4 U 2 ACCES BOT ACCOUNTS THRU E.G. BROWSR, BUT AS NOTD ABOOV - U SHUD USE UR FRIENDLY AUTHENTICATOR (ANDROID, IOS, SDA OR WINAUTH) INSTEAD.

---

### I CAN USE MAH ORIGINAL AUTHENTICATOR AFTR IMPORTIN IT AS ASF 2FA?

YEZ, UR ORIGINAL AUTHENTICATOR REMAINS FUNCSHUNAL AN U CAN USE IT TOGETHR WIF USIN ASF 2FA.c THAZ TEH WHOLE POINT OV TEH PROCES - WERE IMPORTIN UR AUTHENTICATOR CREDENTIALS INTO ASF, SO ASF CAN MAK USE OV THEM AN ACCEPT SELECTD CONFIRMASHUNS ON UR BEHALF.

---

### WER IZ ASF MOBILE AUTHENTICATOR SAVD?

ASF MOBILE AUTHENTICATOR IZ SAVD IN `BotName.db` FILE IN UR CONFIG DIRECTORY, ALONG WIF SUM OTHR CRUSHUL DATA RELATD 2 GIVEN AKOWNT. IF U WANTS 2 REMOOV ASF 2FA, READ HOW BELOW.

---

### HOW 2 REMOOV ASF 2FA?

SIMPLY STOP ASF AN REMOOV ASSOCIATD `BotName.db` OV TEH BOT WIF LINKD ASF 2FA U WANTS 2 REMOOV. DIS OPSHUN WILL REMOOV ASSOCIATD IMPORTD 2FA WIF ASF, BUT WILL NOT DELINK UR AUTHENTICATOR. IF U INSTEAD WANTS 2 DELINK UR AUTHENTICATOR, APART FRUM REMOVIN IT FRUM ASF (FIRSTLY), U SHUD DELINK IT IN AUTHENTICATOR OV UR CHOICE (ANDROID, IOS, SDA OR WINAUTH), OR - IF U CANT 4 SUM REASON, USE REVOCASHUN CODE DAT U RECEIVD DURIN LINKIN DAT AUTHENTICATOR, ON TEH STEAM WEBSIET. IZ NOT POSIBLE 2 UNLINK UR AUTHENTICATOR THRU ASF, DIS AR TEH WUT GENERAL-PURPOSE AUTHENTICATOR DAT U ALREADY HAS SHUD BE USD 4.

---

### I LINKD AUTHENTICATOR IN SDA/WINAUTH, DEN IMPORTD 2 ASF. I CAN NAO UNLINK IT AN LINK IT AGAIN ON MAH FONE?

**NO**. ASF **IMPORTS** UR AUTHENTICATOR DATA IN ORDR 2 USE IT. IF U DELINK UR AUTHENTICATOR DEN ULL ALSO CAUSE ASF 2FA 2 STOP FUNCSHUNIN, REGARDLES IF U REMOOV IT FIRSTLY LIEK STATD IN ABOOV QUESHUN OR NOT. IF U WANTS 2 USE UR AUTHENTICATOR ON BOTH UR FONE AN ASF (PLUS OPSHUNALLY IN SDA/WINAUTH), DEN ULL NED 2 **IMPORT** UR AUTHENTICATOR FRUM UR FONE, AN NOT CREATE NEW WAN IN SDA/WINAUTH. U CAN HAS ONLY **WAN** LINKD AUTHENTICATOR, THAZ Y ASF **IMPORTS** DAT AUTHENTICATOR AN ITZ DATA IN ORDR 2 USE IT AS ASF 2FA - IZ **TEH SAME** AUTHENTICATOR, JUS EXISTIN IN 2 PLACEZ. IF U DECIDE 2 DELINK UR MOBILE AUTHENTICATOR CREDENTIALS - REGARDLES IN WHICH WAI, ASF 2FA WILL STOP WERKIN, AS PREVIOUSLY COPID MOBILE AUTHENTICATOR CREDENTIALS WILL NO LONGR BE VALID. IN ORDR 2 USE ASF 2FA TOGETHR WIF AUTHENTICATOR ON UR FONE, U MUST IMPORT IT FRUM ANDROID/IOS, WHICH IZ DESCRIBD ABOOV.

---

### IZ USIN ASF 2FA BETTR THAN WINAUTH/SDA/OTHR AUTHENTICATOR SET 2 ACCEPT ALL CONFIRMASHUNS?

**YEZ**, IN SEVERAL WAYS. FURST AN MOST IMPORTANT WAN - USIN ASF 2FA **SIGNIFICANTLY** INCREASEZ UR SECURITY, AS ASF 2FA MODULE ENSUREZ DAT ASF WILL ONLY ACCEPT AUTOMATICALLY ITZ OWN CONFIRMASHUNS, SO EVEN IF ATTACKR DOEZ REQUEST TRADE DAT IZ HARMFUL, ASF 2FA WILL **NOT** ACCEPT SUCH TRADE, AS IT WUZ NOT GENERATD BY ASF. IN ADDISHUN 2 SECURITY PART, USIN ASF 2FA ALSO BRINGS PERFORMANCE/OPTIMIZASHUN BENEFITS, AS ASF 2FA FETCHEZ AN ACCEPTS CONFIRMASHUNS IMMEDIATELY AFTR THEYRE GENERATD, AN ONLY DEN, AS OPPOSD 2 INEFFICIENT POLLIN 4 CONFIRMASHUNS EACH X MINUTEZ DUN E.G. BY SDA OR WINAUTH. IN SHORT, THAR IZ NO REASON 2 USE THIRD-PARTY AUTHENTICATOR OVAR ASF 2FA, IF U PLAN ON AUTOMATIN CONFIRMASHUNS GENERATD BY ASF - THAZ EGSAKTLY WUT ASF 2FA IZ 4, AN USIN IT DOEZ NOT CONFLICT WIF U CONFIRMIN EVRYTHIN ELSE IN AUTHENTICATOR OV UR CHOICE. WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND 2 USE ASF 2FA 4 ENTIRE ASF ACTIVITY - DIS AR TEH MUTCH MOAR SECURE THAN ANY OTHR SOLUSHUN.

## ADVANCD

IF URE ADVANCD USR, U CAN ALSO GENERATE MAFILE MANUALLY. DIS CAN BE USD IN CASE UD WANTS 2 IMPORT AUTHENTICATOR FRUM OTHR SOURCEZ THAN TEH ONEZ WEVE DESCRIBD ABOOV. IT SHUD HAS  **[VALID JSON STRUCCHUR](https://jsonlint.com)** OV:

```json
{
  "shared_secret": "STRING",
