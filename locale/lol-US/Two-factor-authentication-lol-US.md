# 2-FACTOR AUTHENTICASHUN

Steam includes two-factor authentication system known as "Escrow" that requires extra details for various account-related activity. U CAN READ MOAR BOUT IT **[HER](https://help.steampowered.com/faqs/view/2E6E-A02C-5581-8904)** AN **[HER](https://help.steampowered.com/faqs/view/34A1-EA3F-83ED-54AB)**. This page considers that 2FA system as well as our solution that integrates with it, called ASF 2FA.

---

# ASF LOGIC

Regardless if you use ASF 2FA or not, ASF includes proper logic and is fully aware of accounts protected by standard 2FA. IT WILL ASK U 4 REQUIRD DETAILS WHEN THEYRE NEEDD (SUCH AS DURIN LOGGIN IN). However, those requests can be automated by using ASF 2FA, which will automatically generate required tokens, saving you hassle and enabling extra functionality (described below).

---

# ASF 2FA

ASF 2FA is a built-in module responsible for providing 2FA features to the ASF process, such as generating tokens and accepting confirmations. It works by duplicating your existing authenticator details, so that you can use your current authenticator and ASF 2FA at the same time.

U CAN VERIFY WHETHR UR BOT AKOWNT IZ USIN ASF 2FA ALREADY BY EXECUTIN `2fa` **[COMMANDZ](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands-lol-US)**. Unless you've already imported your authenticator as ASF 2FA, all standard `2fa` commands will be non-operative, which means that your account is not using ASF 2FA, therefore it's also unavailable for advanced ASF features that require the module to be operative.

---

## Creation

In general we strongly recommend to **[duplicate](#import)** your existing authenticator, as after all, that's the main purpose ASF 2FA was designed for. However, ASF comes with official `MobileAuthenticator` **[plugin](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Plugins)** which further extends ASF 2FA allowing you to link completely new authenticator as well. This can be useful in case you're unable or unwilling to use other tools and you do not mind ASF 2FA to become your main (and maybe only) authenticator.

In order to assign new 2FA and automatically import it as ASF 2FA, you should do the following steps:

1. Create ASF bot for the target account, start it and log in, which you probably already did.
2. Assign working and operative phone number to the account used by the bot **[here](https://store.steampowered.com/phone/manage)**. Phone number is absolutely required, there is no way to add 2FA without it.
3. Execute `2fainit [Bot]` command, replacing `[Bot]` with your bot's name.

Assuming you got a successful reply, the following two things have happened:

- A new `<Bot>.maFile.PENDING` file was generated by ASF in your `config` directory.
- SMS was sent from Steam to the phone number you have assigned for the account above.

The authenticator details are not operative yet, however, you can review the generated file if you'd like to. If you want to be double safe, you can for example already write down revocation code, which is normally explained further below.

4. Once satisfied, execute `2fafinalize [Bot] <ActivationCode>` command, replacing `[Bot]` with your bot's name and `<ActivationCode>` with the code you've received through SMS.

Assuming everything worked properly, previously generated `<Bot>.maFile.PENDING` file was renamed to `<Bot>.maFile.NEW`. This indicates that your 2FA credentials are now valid and active. We recommend you to create a copy of that file and keep it in **secure and safe location**. In addition to that, we recommend you to open it (it's a text file) and write down `revocation_code` which will allow you, as the name implies, to revoke the authenticator in case you lose it.

In regards to technical details, the generated `maFile` includes all details that we have received from Steam server during linking authenticator, and in addition to that `device_id` field which may be needed for other authenticators. The file follows and is fully compatible with **[SDA](#steamdesktopauthenticator)** for import.

ASF automatically imports your authenticator once the procedure is done, therefore `2fa` and other related commands should now be operative for the bot account you linked the authenticator to.

## IMPORT

Import process requires already linked and operational authenticator that is supported by ASF. ASF CURRENTLY SUPPORTS FEW DIFFERENT OFFISHUL AN UNOFFISHUL SOURCEZ OV 2FA - ANDROID, IOS, STEAMDESKTOPAUTHENTICATOR AN WINAUTH, ON TOP OV MANUAL METHOD WHICH ALLOWS U 2 PROVIDE REQUIRD CREDENTIALS YOURSELF. IF U DOAN HAS ANY AUTHENTICATOR YET, U NED 2 CHOOSE WAN OV AVAILABLE APPS AN SET IT UP FIRSTLY. IF U DOAN KNOE BETTR WHICH WAN 2 PICK, WE RECOMMEND WINAUTH, BUT ANY OV TEH ABOOV WILL WERK FINE ASSUMIN U FOLLOW TEH INSTRUCSHUNS.

ALL FOLLOWIN GUIDEZ REQUIRE FRUM U 2 ALREADY HAS **WERKIN AN OPERASHUNAL** AUTHENTICATOR BEAN USD WIF GIVEN TOOL/APPLICASHUN. ASF 2FA WILL NOT OPERATE PROPERLY IF U IMPORT INVALID DATA, THEREFORE MAK SURE DAT UR AUTHENTICATOR WERKZ PROPERLY BEFORE ATTEMPTIN 2 IMPORT IT. DIS DOEZ INCLUDE TESTIN AN VERIFYIN DAT FOLLOWIN AUTHENTICATOR FUNCSHUNS WERK PROPERLY:
- U CAN GENERATE TOKENS AN DOSE TOKENS R ACCEPTD BY STEAM NETWORK
- U CAN FETCH CONFIRMASHUNS, AN THEY R ARRIVIN ON UR MOBILE AUTHENTICATOR
- U CAN ACCEPT DOSE CONFIRMASHUNS, AN THEYRE PROPERLY RECOGNIZD BY STEAM NETWORK AS CONFIRMD/REJECTD

ENSURE DAT UR AUTHENTICATOR WERKZ BY CHECKIN IF ABOOV ACSHUNS WERK - IF THEY DOAN, DEN THEY WONT WERK IN ASF EITHR, ULL ONLY WASTE TIEM AN CAUSE YOURSELF ADDISHUNAL TROUBLE.

### STEAMDESKTOPAUTHENTICATOR

IF U HAS UR AUTHENTICATOR RUNNIN IN SDA ALREADY, U SHUD NOTICE DAT THAR IZ `steamID.maFile` FILE AVAILABLE IN `maFiles` FOLDR. Make sure that `maFile` is in unencrypted form, as ASF can't decrypt SDA files - unencrypted file content should start with `{` and end with `}` character. If needed, you can remove the encryption from SDA settings first, and enable it again when you're done. Once the file is in unencrypted form, copy it to `config` directory of ASF.

You can now rename `steamID.maFile` to `BotName.maFile` in ASF config directory, where `BotName` is the name of your bot you're adding ASF 2FA to. ALTERNATIVELY U CAN LEEF IT AS IT IZ, ASF WILL DEN PICK IT AUTOMATICALLY AFTR LOGGIN IN. Renaming the file helps ASF by making it possible to use ASF 2FA before logging in, if you don't do that, then the file can be picked only after ASF successfully logs in (as ASF doesn't know `steamID` of your account before in fact logging in).

IF U DID EVRYTHIN RITE, LAUNCH ASF, AN U SHUD NOTICE:

```text
[*] INFO: ImportAuthenticator() <1> Converting .maFile into ASF format...
[*] INFO: ImportAuthenticator() <1> Successfully finished importing mobile authenticator!
```

FRUM NAO ON, UR ASF 2FA SHUD BE OPERASHUNAL 4 DIS AKOWNT.

---

### WINAUTH

FIRSTLY CREATE NEW EMPTY `BotName.maFile` IN ASF CONFIG DIRECTORY, WER `BotName` IZ TEH NAYM OV UR BOT URE ADDIN ASF 2FA 2. REMEMBR DAT IT SHUD BE `BotName.maFile` AN NOT `BotName.maFile.txt`, WINDOWS LIKEZ 2 HIDE KNOWN EXTENSHUNS BY DEFAULT. IF U PROVIDE INCORRECT NAYM, IT WONT BE PICKD BY ASF.

NAO LAUNCH WINAUTH AS USUAL. RITE CLICK ON STEAM ICON AN SELECT "SHOW STEAMGUARD AN RECOVERY CODE". DEN CHECK "ALLOW COPY". U SHUD NOTICE FAMILIAR 2 U JSON STRUCCHUR ON TEH BOTTOM OV TEH WINDOW, STARTIN WIF `{`. COPY WHOLE TEXT INTO `BotName.maFile` FILE CREATD BY U IN PREVIOUS STEP.

IF U DID EVRYTHIN RITE, LAUNCH ASF, AN U SHUD NOTICE:

```text
[*] INFO: ImportAuthenticator() <1> Converting .maFile into ASF format...
[*] INFO: ImportAuthenticator() <1> Successfully finished importing mobile authenticator!
```

FRUM NAO ON, UR ASF 2FA SHUD BE OPERASHUNAL 4 DIS AKOWNT.

---

## DUN

FRUM DIS MOMENT, ALL `2fa` COMMANDZ WILL WERK AS THEYD BE CALLD ON UR CLASIC 2FA DEVICE. U CAN USE BOTH ASF 2FA AN UR AUTHENTICATOR OV CHOICE (ANDROID, IOS, SDA OR WINAUTH) 2 GENERATE TOKENS AN ACCEPT CONFIRMASHUNS.

IF U HAS AUTHENTICATOR ON UR FONE, U CAN OPSHUNALLY REMOOV STEAMDESKTOPAUTHENTICATOR AN/OR WINAUTH, AS WE WONT NED IT NOMORE. HOWEVR, I SUGGEST 2 KEEP IT JUS IN CASE, NOT 2 MENSHUN DAT IZ MOAR HANDY THAN NORMAL STEAM AUTHENTICATOR. Just keep in mind that ASF 2FA is **NOT** a general purpose authenticator, it doesn't include all data that authenticator should have, but limited subset of original `maFile`. It's not possible to convert ASF 2FA back to original authenticator, therefore always make sure that you have general-purpose authenticator or `maFile` in other place, such as in WinAuth/SDA, or on your phone.

## FAQ

### HOW IZ ASF MAKIN USE OV 2FA MODULE?

IF ASF 2FA IZ AVAILABLE, ASF WILL USE IT 4 AUTOMATIC CONFIRMASHUN OV TRADEZ DAT R BEAN SENT/ACCEPTD BY ASF. IT WILL ALSO BE CAPABLE OV AUTOMATICALLY GENERATIN 2FA TOKENS ON AS-NEEDD BASIS, 4 EXAMPLE IN ORDR 2 LOG IN. IN ADDISHUN 2 DAT, HAVIN ASF 2FA ALSO ENABLEZ `2fa` COMMANDZ 4 U 2 USE. DAT SHUD BE ALL 4 NAO, IF I DIDNT FORGET BOUT ANYTHIN - BASICALLY ASF USEZ 2FA MODULE ON AS-NEEDD BASIS.

---

### WUT IF NEEDZ 2FA TOKEN?

U WILL NED 2FA TOKEN 2 ACCES 2FA-PROTECTD AKOWNT, DAT INCLUDEZ EVRY AKOWNT WIF ASF 2FA AS WELL. U SHUD GENERATE TOKENS IN AUTHENTICATOR DAT U USD 4 IMPORT, BUT U CAN ALSO GENERATE TEMPORARY TOKENS THRU `2fa` COMMAND SENT VIA TEH CHAT 2 GIVEN BOT. U CAN ALSO USE `2fa <BotNames>` COMMAND 2 GENERATE TEMPORARY TOKEN 4 GIVEN BOT INSTANCEZ. DIS SHUD BE ENOUGH 4 U 2 ACCES BOT ACCOUNTS THRU E.G. BROWSR, BUT AS NOTD ABOOV - U SHUD USE UR FRIENDLY AUTHENTICATOR (ANDROID, IOS, SDA OR WINAUTH) INSTEAD.

---

### I CAN USE MAH ORIGINAL AUTHENTICATOR AFTR IMPORTIN IT AS ASF 2FA?

YEZ, UR ORIGINAL AUTHENTICATOR REMAINS FUNCSHUNAL AN U CAN USE IT TOGETHR WIF USIN ASF 2FA.c THAZ TEH WHOLE POINT OV TEH PROCES - WERE IMPORTIN UR AUTHENTICATOR CREDENTIALS INTO ASF, SO ASF CAN MAK USE OV THEM AN ACCEPT SELECTD CONFIRMASHUNS ON UR BEHALF.

---

### WER IZ ASF MOBILE AUTHENTICATOR SAVD?

ASF MOBILE AUTHENTICATOR IZ SAVD IN `BotName.db` FILE IN UR CONFIG DIRECTORY, ALONG WIF SUM OTHR CRUSHUL DATA RELATD 2 GIVEN AKOWNT. IF U WANTS 2 REMOOV ASF 2FA, READ HOW BELOW.

---

### HOW 2 REMOOV ASF 2FA?

SIMPLY STOP ASF AN REMOOV ASSOCIATD `BotName.db` OV TEH BOT WIF LINKD ASF 2FA U WANTS 2 REMOOV. DIS OPSHUN WILL REMOOV ASSOCIATD IMPORTD 2FA WIF ASF, BUT WILL NOT DELINK UR AUTHENTICATOR. IF U INSTEAD WANTS 2 DELINK UR AUTHENTICATOR, APART FRUM REMOVIN IT FRUM ASF (FIRSTLY), U SHUD DELINK IT IN AUTHENTICATOR OV UR CHOICE (ANDROID, IOS, SDA OR WINAUTH), OR - IF U CANT 4 SUM REASON, USE REVOCASHUN CODE DAT U RECEIVD DURIN LINKIN DAT AUTHENTICATOR, ON TEH STEAM WEBSIET. IZ NOT POSIBLE 2 UNLINK UR AUTHENTICATOR THRU ASF, DIS AR TEH WUT GENERAL-PURPOSE AUTHENTICATOR DAT U ALREADY HAS SHUD BE USD 4.

---

### I LINKD AUTHENTICATOR IN SDA/WINAUTH, DEN IMPORTD 2 ASF. I CAN NAO UNLINK IT AN LINK IT AGAIN ON MAH FONE?

**NO**. ASF **IMPORTS** UR AUTHENTICATOR DATA IN ORDR 2 USE IT. IF U DELINK UR AUTHENTICATOR DEN ULL ALSO CAUSE ASF 2FA 2 STOP FUNCSHUNIN, REGARDLES IF U REMOOV IT FIRSTLY LIEK STATD IN ABOOV QUESHUN OR NOT. IF U WANTS 2 USE UR AUTHENTICATOR ON BOTH UR FONE AN ASF (PLUS OPSHUNALLY IN SDA/WINAUTH), DEN ULL NED 2 **IMPORT** UR AUTHENTICATOR FRUM UR FONE, AN NOT CREATE NEW WAN IN SDA/WINAUTH. U CAN HAS ONLY **WAN** LINKD AUTHENTICATOR, THAZ Y ASF **IMPORTS** DAT AUTHENTICATOR AN ITZ DATA IN ORDR 2 USE IT AS ASF 2FA - IZ **TEH SAME** AUTHENTICATOR, JUS EXISTIN IN 2 PLACEZ. IF U DECIDE 2 DELINK UR MOBILE AUTHENTICATOR CREDENTIALS - REGARDLES IN WHICH WAI, ASF 2FA WILL STOP WERKIN, AS PREVIOUSLY COPID MOBILE AUTHENTICATOR CREDENTIALS WILL NO LONGR BE VALID. IN ORDR 2 USE ASF 2FA TOGETHR WIF AUTHENTICATOR ON UR FONE, U MUST IMPORT IT FRUM ANDROID/IOS, WHICH IZ DESCRIBD ABOOV.

---

### IZ USIN ASF 2FA BETTR THAN WINAUTH/SDA/OTHR AUTHENTICATOR SET 2 ACCEPT ALL CONFIRMASHUNS?

**YEZ**, IN SEVERAL WAYS. FURST AN MOST IMPORTANT WAN - USIN ASF 2FA **SIGNIFICANTLY** INCREASEZ UR SECURITY, AS ASF 2FA MODULE ENSUREZ DAT ASF WILL ONLY ACCEPT AUTOMATICALLY ITZ OWN CONFIRMASHUNS, SO EVEN IF ATTACKR DOEZ REQUEST TRADE DAT IZ HARMFUL, ASF 2FA WILL **NOT** ACCEPT SUCH TRADE, AS IT WUZ NOT GENERATD BY ASF. IN ADDISHUN 2 SECURITY PART, USIN ASF 2FA ALSO BRINGS PERFORMANCE/OPTIMIZASHUN BENEFITS, AS ASF 2FA FETCHEZ AN ACCEPTS CONFIRMASHUNS IMMEDIATELY AFTR THEYRE GENERATD, AN ONLY DEN, AS OPPOSD 2 INEFFICIENT POLLIN 4 CONFIRMASHUNS EACH X MINUTEZ DUN E.G. BY SDA OR WINAUTH. IN SHORT, THAR IZ NO REASON 2 USE THIRD-PARTY AUTHENTICATOR OVAR ASF 2FA, IF U PLAN ON AUTOMATIN CONFIRMASHUNS GENERATD BY ASF - THAZ EGSAKTLY WUT ASF 2FA IZ 4, AN USIN IT DOEZ NOT CONFLICT WIF U CONFIRMIN EVRYTHIN ELSE IN AUTHENTICATOR OV UR CHOICE. WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND 2 USE ASF 2FA 4 ENTIRE ASF ACTIVITY - DIS AR TEH MUTCH MOAR SECURE THAN ANY OTHR SOLUSHUN.
