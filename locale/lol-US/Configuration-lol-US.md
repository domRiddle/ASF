## Introducshun

ASF CONFIGURASHUN IZ DIVIDD INTO 2 MAJOR PARTS - GLOBAL (PROCES) CONFIGURASHUN, AN CONFIGURASHUN OV EVRY BOT. EVRY BOT HAS ITZ OWN BOT CONFIGURASHUN FILE NAMD `BOTNAME.JSON` (WER `BOTNAME` IZ TEH NAYM OV TEH BOT), WHILE GLOBAL ASF (PROCES) CONFIGURASHUN IZ SINGLE FILE NAMD `ASF.JSON`.

A BOT IZ SINGLE STEAM AKOWNT DAT IZ TAKIN PART IN ASF PROCES. IN ORDR 2 WERK PROPERLY, ASF NEEDZ AT LEAST **WAN** DEFIND BOT INSTANCE. THAR IZ NO PROCES-ENFORCD LIMIT OV BOT INSTANCEZ, SO U CAN USE AS LOTZ DA BOTS (STEAM ACCOUNTS) AS U WANTS 2.

ASF IZ USIN **<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</A>** FORMAT 4 STORIN ITZ CONFIG FILEZ. IZ HOOMAN-FRIENDLY, READABLE AN VRY UNIVERSAL FORMAT IN WHICH U CAN CONFIGURE TEH PROGRAM. DOAN WORRY THOUGH, U DOAN NED 2 KNOE JSON IN ORDR 2 CONFIGURE ASF. I JUS MENSHUND IT IN CASE UD ALREADY WANTS 2 MAS-CREATE ASF CONFIGS WIF SUM SORT OV BASH SCRIPT.

CONFIGURASHUN CAN BE DUN IN SEVERAL WAYS. U CAN USE R **<A HREF="https://justarchinet.github.io/ASF-WebConfigGenerator">WEB-BASD CONFIGGENERATOR</A>**, WHICH IZ LOCAL APP INDEPENDENT OV ASF. U CAN USE R **<A HREF="https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/IPC#asf-ui">ASF-UI</A>** IPC FRONTEND 4 CONFIGURASHUN DUN DIRECTLY IN ASF. LASTLY, U CAN ALWAYS GENERATE CONFIG FILEZ MANUALLY, AS THEY FOLLOW FIXD JSON STRUCCHUR SPECIFID BELOW. WELL EXPLAIN SHORTLY TEH AVAILABLE OPSHUNS.

* * *

## WEB-BASD CONFIGGENERATOR

TEH PURPOSE OV R **<A HREF="https://justarchinet.github.io/ASF-WebConfigGenerator">WEB-BASD CONFIGGENERATOR</A>** IZ 2 PROVIDE U WIF FRIENDLY FRONTEND DAT IZ USD 4 GENERATIN ASF CONFIGURASHUN FILEZ. WEB-BASD CONFIGGENERATOR IZ 100% CLIENT-BASD, WHICH MEANZ DAT TEH DETAILS URE INPUTTIN R NOT BEAN SENT ANYWHERE, BUT PROCESD LOCALLY ONLY. DIS GUARANTEEZ SECURITY AN RELIABILITY, AS IT CAN EVEN WERK **<A HREF="https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ASF-WebConfigGenerator/tree/main/docs">OFFLINE</A>** IF UD LIEK 2 DOWNLOAD ALL TEH FILEZ AN RUN `INDEX.HTML` IN UR FAVOURITE BROWSR.

WEB-BASD CONFIGGENERATOR IZ VERIFID 2 RUN PROPERLY ON CHROME AN FIREFOX, BUT IT SHUD WERK PROPERLY IN ALL MOST POPULAR JAVASCRIPT-ENABLD BROWSERS.

TEH USAGE IZ QUITE SIMPLE - SELECT WHETHR U WANTS 2 GENERATE `ASF` OR `BOT` CONFIG BY SWITCHIN 2 PROPR TAB, ENSURE DAT CHOSEN VERSHUN OV CONFIG FILE MATCHEZ UR ASF RELEASE, DEN INPUT ALL DETAILS AN HIT "DOWNLOAD" BUTN. MOOV DIS FILE 2 ASF `CONFIG` DIRECTORY, OVERWRITIN EXISTIN FILEZ IF NEEDD. REPEAT 4 ALL EVENTUAL FURTHR MODIFICASHUNS AN REFR 2 TEH REST OV DIS SECSHUN 4 EXPLANASHUN OV ALL AVAILABLE OPSHUNS 2 CONFIGURE.

* * *

## ASF-UI CONFIGURASHUN

R **<A HREF="HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/JUSTARCHINET/ARCHISTEAMFARM/WIKI/IPC#ASF-UI">ASF-UI</A>** IPC INTERFACE ALLOWS U 2 CONFIGURE ASF AS WELL, AN IZ SUPERIOR SOLUSHUN 4 RECONFIGURIN ASF AFTR GENERATIN TEH INITIAL CONFIGS DUE 2 TEH FACT DAT IT CAN EDIT TEH CONFIGS IN-PLACE, AS OPPOSD 2 WEB-BASD CONFIGGENERATOR WHICH GENERATEZ THEM STATICALLY.

IN ORDR 2 USE ASF-UI, FIRSTLY U MUST ENABLE R **<A HREF="https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/IPC">IPC</A>** INTERFACE ITSELF. U CAN DO DAT BY USIN R WEB-BASD CONFIGGENERATOR EXPLAIND ABOOV, GENERATIN VRY SIMPLE `ASF` CONFIG WIF ENABLD `IPC` SETTIN AN NOTHIN ELSE. ALTERNATIVELY, U CUD ALSO GENERATE SUCH SIMPLE CONFIG YOURSELF, AS `ASF.JSON` FILE WIF `{ "IPC": TRUE }` JSON CONTENT INSIDE.

AFTERWARDZ, LAUNCH ASF WIF TEH ABOOV CONFIG, ENSURE DAT `IPC` INTERFACE IZ STARTD, DEN NAVIGATE 2 ASFS **<A HREF="http://localhost:1242">IPC ADDRES</A>**. U CAN NAO DO TEH REMAININ CONFIGURASHUN OV ASF THRU ASF-UI INTERFACE.

* * *

## MANUAL CONFIGURASHUN

IN GENERAL WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND USIN EITHR R CONFIGGENERATOR OR ASF-UI, AS IZ MUTCH EASIR AN ENSUREZ U WONT MAK MISTAEK IN DA JSON STRUCCHUR, BUT IF 4 SUM REASON U DOAN WANTS 2, DEN U CAN ALSO CREATE PROPR CONFIGS MANUALLY. CHECK JSON EXAMPLEZ BELOW 4 GUD START IN PROPR STRUCCHUR, U CAN COPY TEH CONTENT INTO FILE AN USE IT AS BASE 4 UR CONFIG. SINCE URE NOT USIN ANY OV R FRONTENDZ, ENSURE DAT UR CONFIG IZ **<A HREF="https://jsonlint.com">VALID</A>**, AS ASF WILL REFUSE 2 LOAD IT IF IT CANT BE PARSD. EVEN IF IT BE VALID JSON, U ALSO HAS 2 ENSURE DAT ALL TEH PROPERTIEZ HAS TEH PROPR TYPE, AS REQUIRD BY ASF. 4 PROPR JSON STRUCCHUR OV ALL AVAILABLE FIELDZ, REFR 2 **[JSON MAPPIN](#json-mappin)** SECSHUN AN R DOCUMENTASHUN BELOW.

## GLOBAL CONFIG

GLOBAL CONFIG IZ LOCATD IN `ASF.JSON` FILE AN HAS FOLLOWIN STRUCCHUR:

ALL OPSHUNS R EXPLAIND BELOW:

### `AutoRestart`

`BOOL` TYPE WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `TRUE`. DIS PROPERTY DEFINEZ IF ASF IZ ALLOWD 2 PERFORM SELF-RESTART WHEN NEEDD. THAR R FEW EVENTS DAT WILL REQUIRE FRUM ASF SELF-RESTART, SUCH AS ASF UPDATE (DUN WIF `UPDATEPERIOD` OR `UPDATE` COMMAND), AS WELL AS `ASF.JSON` CONFIG EDIT, `RESTART` COMMAND AN LIKEWIZE. TYPICALLY, RESTART INCLUDEZ 2 PARTS - CREATIN NEW PROCES, AN FINISHIN CURRENT WAN. MOST USERS SHUD BE FINE WIF IT AN KEEP DIS PROPERTY WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `TRUE`, HOWEVR - IF URE RUNNIN ASF THRU UR OWN SCRIPT AN/OR WIF `DOTNET`, U CUD WANTS 2 HAS FULL CONTROL OVAR STARTIN TEH PROCES, AN AVOID SITUASHUN SUCH AS HAVIN NEW (RESTARTD) ASF PROCES RUNNIN SOMEWHERE SILENTLY IN DA BAKGROUND, AN NOT IN DA FOREGROUND OV TEH SCRIPT, DAT EXITD TOGETHR WIF OLD ASF PROCES. DIS AR TEH ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT CONSIDERIN TEH FACT DAT NEW PROCES WILL NO LONGR BE UR DIRECT CHILD, WHICH WUD MAK U UNABLE E.G. 2 USE STANDARD CONSOLE INPUT 4 IT.

IF THAZ TEH CASE, DIS PROPERTY IF SPECIALLY 4 U AN U CAN SET IT 2 `FALSE`. HOWEVR, KEEP IN MIND DAT IN SUCH CASE **U** R RESPONSIBLE 4 RESTARTIN TEH PROCES. DIS AR TEH SOMEHOW IMPORTANT AS ASF WILL ONLY EXIT INSTEAD OV SPAWNIN NEW PROCES (E.G. AFTR UPDATE), SO IF THAR IZ NO LOGIC ADDD BY U, ITLL SIMPLY STOP WERKIN TIL U START IT AGAIN. ASF ALWAYS EXITS WIF PROPR ERROR CODE INDICATIN SUCCES (ZERO) OR NON-SUCCES (NON-ZERO), DIS WAI URE ABLE 2 ADD PROPR LOGIC IN UR SCRIPT WHICH SHUD AVOID AUTO-RESTARTIN ASF IN CASE OV FAILURE, OR AT LEAST MAK LOCAL COPY OV `LOG.TXT` 4 FURTHR ANALYSIS. ALSO KEEP IN MIND DAT `RESTART` COMMAND WILL ALWAYS RESTART ASF REGARDLES OV HOW DIS PROPERTY IZ SET, AS DIS PROPERTY DEFINEZ DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR, WHILE `RESTART` COMMAND ALWAYS RESTARTS TEH PROCES. UNLES U HAS REASON 2 DISABLE DIS FEACHUR, U SHUD KEEP IT ENABLD.

* * *

### `Blacklist`

`IMMUTABLEHASHSET<UINT>` TYPE WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV BEAN EMPTY. AS TEH NAYM SUGGESTS, DIS GLOBAL CONFIG PROPERTY DEFINEZ APPIDZ (GAMEZ) DAT WILL BE ENTIRELY IGNORD BY AUTOMATIC ASF IDLIN PROCES. UNFORTUNATELY STEAM LOVEZ 2 FLAG SUMMR/WINTR SALE BADGEZ AS "AVAILABLE 4 CARDZ DROP", WHICH CONFUSEZ ASF PROCES BY MAKIN IT BLEEV DAT IT BE VALID GAME DAT SHUD BE FARMD. IF THAR WUZ NO ANY KIND OV BLACKLIST, ASF WUD EVENTUALLY "HANG" AT FARMIN GAME WHICH IZ IN FACT NOT GAME, AN WAIT INFINITELY 4 CARDZ DROP DAT WILL NOT HAPPEN. ASF BLACKLIST SERVEZ PURPOSE OV MARKIN DOSE BADGEZ AS NOT AVAILABLE 4 FARMIN, SO WE CAN SILENTLY IGNORE THEM WHEN DECIDIN WUT 2 FARM, AN NOT FALL INTO TEH TRAP.

ASF INCLUDEZ 2 BLACKLISTS BY DEFAULT - `GLOBALBLACKLIST`, WHICH IZ HARDCODD INTO TEH ASF CODE AN NOT POSIBLE 2 EDIT, AN NORMAL `BLACKLIST`, WHICH IZ DEFIND HER. `GLOBALBLACKLIST` IZ UPDATD TOGETHR WIF ASF VERSHUN AN TYPICALLY INCLUDEZ ALL "BAD" APPIDZ AT TEH TIEM OV RELEASE, SO IF URE USIN UP-2-DATE ASF DEN U DO NOT NED 2 MAINTAIN UR OWN `BLACKLIST` DEFIND HER. TEH MAIN PURPOSE OV DIS PROPERTY IZ 2 ALLOW U BLACKLISTIN NEW, NOT-KNOWN AT TEH TIEM OV ASF RELEASE APPIDZ, WHICH SHUD NOT BE FARMD. HARDCODD `GLOBALBLACKLIST` IZ BEAN UPDATD AS FAST AS POSIBLE, THEREFORE URE NOT REQUIRD 2 UPDATE UR OWN `BLACKLIST` IF URE USIN LATEST ASF VERSHUN, BUT WITHOUT `BLACKLIST` UD BE FORCD 2 UPDATE ASF IN ORDR 2 "KEEP RUNNIN" WHEN VALVE RELEASEZ NEW SALE BADGE - I DOAN WANTS 2 FORCE U 2 USE LATEST ASF CODE, THEREFORE DIS PROPERTY IZ HER 2 ALLOW U "FIXIN" ASF YOURSELF IF U 4 SUM REASON DOAN WANTS 2, OR CANT, UPDATE 2 NEW HARDCODD `GLOBALBLACKLIST` IN NEW ASF RELEASE, YET U WANTS 2 KEEP UR OLD ASF RUNNIN. UNLES U HAS **STRONG** REASON 2 EDIT DIS PROPERTY, U SHUD KEEP IT AT DEFAULT.

IF URE LOOKIN 4 BOT-BASD BLACKLIST INSTEAD, TAEK LOOK AT `IB`, `IBADD` AN `IBRM` **<A HREF="https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands">COMMANDZ</A>**.

* * *

### `CommandPrefix`

`STRIN` TYPE WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `!`. DIS PROPERTY SPECIFIEZ **CASE-SENSITIV** PREFIX USD 4 ASF **<A HREF="https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands">COMMANDZ</A>**. IN OTHR WERDZ, DIS AR TEH WUT U NED 2 PREPEND 2 EACH ASF COMMAND IN ORDR 2 MAK ASF LISTEN 2 U. IZ POSIBLE 2 SET DIS VALUE 2 `NULL` OR EMPTY IN ORDR 2 MAK ASF USE NO COMMAND PREFIX, IN WHICH CASE U INPUT COMMANDZ WIF THEIR PLAIN IDENTIFIERS. HOWEVR, DOIN SO WILL POTENTIALLY DECREASE ASFS PERFORMANCE AS ASF IZ OPTIMIZD 2 NOT PARSE MESAGE FURTHR IF IT DOESNT START WIF `COMMANDPREFIX` - IF U INTENSHUNALLY DECIDE 2 NOT USE IT, ASF WILL BE FORCD 2 READ ALL MESAGEZ AN RESPOND 2 THEM, EVEN IF THEYRE NOT ASF COMMANDZ. THEREFORE IZ RECOMMENDD 2 KEEP USIN SUM `COMMANDPREFIX`, SUCH AS `/` IF U DOAN LIEK DEFAULT VALUE OV `!`. 4 CONSISTENCY, `COMMANDPREFIX` AFFECTS TEH ENTIRE ASF PROCES. UNLES U HAS REASON 2 EDIT DIS PROPERTY, U SHUD KEEP IT AT DEFAULT.

* * *

### `ConfirmationsLimiterDelay`

`BYTE` TYPE WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `10`. ASF WILL ENSURE DAT THAR WILL BE AT LEAST `CONFIRMASHUNSLIMITERDELAY` SECONDZ IN TWEEN OV 2 CONSECUTIV 2FA CONFIRMASHUNS FETCHIN REQUESTS 2 AVOID TRIGGERIN RATE-LIMIT - DOSE R BEAN USD BY **<A HREF="https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Two-factor-authentication">ASF 2FA</A>** DURIN E.G. `2FAOK` COMMAND, AS WELL AS ON AS-NEEDD BASIS WHEN PERFORMIN VARIOUS TRADIN-RELATD OPERASHUNS. DEFAULT VALUE WUZ SET BASD ON R TESTS AN SHUD NOT BE LOWERD IF U DOAN WANTS 2 RUN INTO ISSUEZ. UNLES U HAS **STRONG** REASON 2 EDIT DIS PROPERTY, U SHUD KEEP IT AT DEFAULT.

* * *

### `ConnectionTimeout`

`BYTE` TYPE WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `90`. DIS PROPERTY DEFINEZ TIEMOUTS 4 VARIOUS NETWORK ACSHUNS DUN BY ASF, IN SECONDZ. IN PARTICULAR, `CONNECSHUNTIMEOUT` DEFINEZ TIEMOUT IN SECONDZ 4 HTTP AN IPC REQUESTS, `CONNECSHUNTIMEOUT / 10` DEFINEZ MAXIMUM NUMBR OV FAILD HEARTBEATS, WHILE `CONNECSHUNTIMEOUT / 30` DEFINEZ NUMBR OV MINUTEZ WE ALLOW 4 INITIAL STEAM NETWORK CONNECSHUN REQUEST. DEFAULT VALUE OV `90` SHUD BE FINE 4 MAJORITY OV PEEPS, HOWEVR, IF U HAS RATHR SLOW NETWORK CONNECSHUN OR PC, U CUD WANTS 2 INCREASE DIS NUMBR 2 SOMETHIN HIGHR (LIEK `120`). KEEP IN MIND DAT BIGGR VALUEZ WILL NOT MAGICALLY FIX SLOW OR EVEN INACCESIBLE STEAM SERVERS, SO WE SHOULDNT INFINITELY WAIT 4 SOMETHIN DAT WONT HAPPEN AN SIMPLY TRY AGAIN LATR. SETTIN DIS VALUE 2 HIGH WILL RESULT IN EXCESIV DELAY IN KATCHIN NETWORK ISSUEZ, AS WELL AS IN DECREASE OV OVERALL PERFORMANCE. SETTIN DIS VALUE 2 LOW WILL DECREASE OVERALL STABILITY AN PERFORMANCE AS WELL, AS ASF WILL ABORT VALID REQUEST STILL BEAN PARSD. THEREFORE SETTIN DIS VALUE LOWR THAN DEFAULT HAS NO ADVANTAGE IN GENERAL, AS STEAM SERVERS TEND 2 BE SUPR SLOW FRUM TIEM 2 TIEM, AN CUD REQUIRE MOAR TIEM 4 PARSIN ASF REQUESTS. DEFAULT VALUE IZ BALANCE TWEEN BELIEVIN DAT R NETWORK CONNECSHUN IZ STABLE, AN DOUBTIN IN STEAM NETWORK 2 HANDLE R REQUEST IN GIVEN TIEMOUT. IF U WANTS 2 DETECT ISSUEZ SOONR AN MAK ASF RECONNECT/RESPOND FASTR, DEFAULT VALUE SHUD DO (OR VRY SLIGHTLY BELOW, LIEK `60`, MAKIN ASF LES PATIENT). IF U INSTEAD NOTICE DAT ASF IZ RUNNIN INTO NETWORK ISSUEZ, SUCH AS FAILIN REQUESTS, HEARTBEATS BEAN LOST OR CONNECSHUN 2 STEAM INTERRUPTD, IT PROBABLY MAKEZ SENSE 2 INCREASE DIS VALUE IF URE SURE DAT IZ **NOT** CAUSD BY UR NETWORK, BUT BY STEAM ITSELF, AS INCREASIN TIEMOUTS MAKEZ ASF MOAR "PATIENT" AN NOT DECIDIN 2 RECONNECT RITE AWAY.

AN EXAMPLE SITUASHUN DAT CUD REQUIRE INCREASE OV DIS PROPERTY IZ LETTIN ASF 2 DEAL WIF VRY HUGE TRADE OFFERS DAT CAN TAEK GUD 2+ MINUTEZ 2 BE FULLY ACCEPTD AN HANDLD BY STEAM. BY INCREASIN DEFAULT TIEMOUT, ASF WILL BE MOAR PATIENT AN WAIT LONGR BEFORE DECIDIN DAT TEH TRADE IZ NOT GOIN THRU AN ABANDON TEH INITIAL REQUEST.

ANOTHR SITUASHUN CUD BE CAUSD BY VRY SLOW MACHINE OR INTERNET CONNECSHUN DAT REQUIREZ MOAR TIEM 2 HANDLE TEH DATA BEAN TRANZMITTD. DIS AR TEH PRITEE RARE CONDISHUN, AS TEH CPU/NETWORK BANDWIDTH IZ ALMOST NEVR BOTTLENECK, BUT STILL POSIBILITY WORTH MENSHUNIN.

IN SHORT, DEFAULT VALUE SHUD BE DESENT 4 MOST CASEZ, BUT U CUD WANTS 2 INCREASE IT IF NEEDD. STILL, GOIN FAR ABOOV TEH DEFAULT VALUE DOESNT MAK MUTCH SENSE EITHR, SINCE BIGGR TIEMOUTS WONT MAGICALLY FIX INACCESIBLE STEAM SERVERS. UNLES U HAS REASON 2 EDIT DIS PROPERTY, U SHUD KEEP IT AT DEFAULT.

* * *

### `CURRENTCULCHUR`

`STRIN` TYPE WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `NUALL`. BY DEFAULT ASF ATTEMPTS 2 USE UR OPERATIN SISTEM LANGUAGE, AN WILL PREFR 2 USE TRANZLATD STRINGS IN DAT LANGUAGE IF AVAILABLE. DIS AR TEH POSIBLE THX 2 R COMMUNITY DAT TRIEZ 2 **<A HREF="https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Localization">LOCALIZE</A>** ASF IN ALL MOST POPULAR LANGUAGEZ. IF 4 SUM REASON U DOAN WANTS 2 USE UR OS NATIV LANGUAGE, U CAN USE DIS CONFIG PROPERTY 2 PICK ANY VALID LANGUAGE UD WANTS 2 USE INSTEAD. 4 LIST OV ALL AVAILABLE CULTUREZ, PLZ VISIT **<A HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc233982.aspx">MSDN</A>** AN LOOK 4 `LANGUAGE TAG`. IZ NICE 2 NOWT DAT ASF ACCEPTS BOTH SPECIFIC CULTUREZ, SUCH AS `EN-GB`, BUT ALSO NEUTRAL ONEZ, SUCH AS `EN`. SPECIFYIN CURRENT CULCHUR WILL ALSO AFFECT OTHR CULCHUR-SPECIFIC BEHAVIOUR, SUCH AS CURRENCY/DATE FORMAT AN ALIKE. PLZ NOWT DAT U CUD NED ADDISHUNAL FONT/LANGUAGE PACKZ 4 DISPLAYIN LANGUAGE-SPECIFIC CHARACTERS PROPERLY, IF U PICKD NON-NATIV CULCHUR DAT MAKEZ USE OV THEM. TYPICALLY U WANTS 2 MAK USE OV DIS CONFIG PROPERTY IF U PREFR ASF IN ENGLISH INSTEAD OV UR NATIV LANGUAGE.

* * *

### `Debug`

`BOOL` TYPE WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `FALSE`. DIS PROPERTY DEFINEZ IF PROCES SHUD RUN IN DEBUG MODE. WHEN IN DEBUG MODE, ASF CREATEZ SPESHUL `DEBUG` DIRECTORY NEXT 2 TEH `CONFIG`, WHICH KEEPS TRACK OV WHOLE COMMUNICASHUN TWEEN ASF AN STEAM SERVERS. DEBUG INFORMASHUN CAN HALP SPOTTIN NASTY ISSUEZ RELATD 2 NETWORKIN AN GENERAL ASF WERKFLOW. IN ADDISHUN 2 DAT, SUM PROGRAM ROUTINEZ WILL BE FAR MOAR VERBOSE, SUCH AS `WEBBROWSR` STATIN EGSAKT REASON Y SUM REQUESTS R FAILIN - DOSE ENTRIEZ R WRITTEN 2 NORMAL ASF LOG. **U SHUD NOT RUN ASF IN DEBUG MODE, UNLES ASKD BY DEVELOPR**. RUNNIN ASF IN DEBUG MODE **DECREASEZ PERFORMANCE**, **AFFECTS STABILITY NEGATIVELY** AN IZ **FAR MOAR VERBOSE IN VARIOUS PLACEZ**, SO IT SHUD BE USD **ONLY** INTENSHUNALLY, IN SHORT-RUN, 4 DEBUGGIN PARTICULAR ISSUE, REPRODUCIN TEH PROBLEM OR GETTIN MOAR INFO BOUT FAILIN REQUEST, AN ALIKE, BUT **NOT** 4 NORMAL PROGRAM EXECUSHUN. U WILL C **A LOT** OV NEW ERRORS, ISSUEZ, AN EXCEPSHUNS - MAK SURE DAT U HAS DESENT KNOWLEDGE BOUT ASF, STEAM AN ITZ QUIRKZ IF U DECIDE 2 ANALYZE ALL OV DAT YOURSELF, AS NOT EVRYTHIN IZ RELEVANT. 

**WARNIN:** ENABLIN DIS MODE INCLUDEZ LOGGIN OV **POTENTIALLY SENSITIV** INFORMASHUN SUCH AS LOGINS AN PASWORDZ DAT URE USIN 4 LOGGIN IN 2 STEAM (DUE 2 NETWORK LOGGIN). DAT DATA IZ WRITTEN 2 BOTH `DEBUG` DIRECTORY, AS WELL AS STANDARD `LOG.TXT` (DAT IZ NAO INTENSHUNALLY MUTCH MOAR VERBOSE 2 LOG DIS INFO). U SHUD NOT POST DEBUG CONTENT GENERATD BY ASF IN ANY PUBLIC LOCASHUN, ASF DEVELOPR SHUD ALWAYS REMIND U OV SENDIN IT 2 HIS E-MAIL, OR OTHR SECURE LOCASHUN. WERE NOT STORIN, NEITHR MAKIN USE OV DOSE SENSITIV DETAILS, THEYRE WRITTEN AS PART OV DEBUG ROUTINEZ SINCE THEIR PRESENCE CUD BE RELEVANT 2 TEH ISSUE DAT IZ AFFECTIN U. WED PREFR IF U DIDNT ALTR ASF LOGGIN IN ANY WAI, BUT IF URE WORRID, URE FREE 2 REDACT DOSE SENSITIV DETAILS APPROPRIATELY.

> REDACTIN INVOLVEZ REPLACIN SENSITIV DETAILS, 4 EXAMPLE WIF STARS. U SHUD REFRAIN FRUM REMOVIN SENSITIV LINEZ ENTIRELY, AS THEIR PURE EXISTENCE CUD BE RELEVANT AN SHUD BE PRESERVD.

* * *

### `FARMINGDELAY`

`BYTE` TYPE WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `15`. IN ORDR 4 ASF 2 WERK, IT WILL CHECK CURRENTLY FARMD GAME EVRY `FARMINGDELAY` MINUTEZ, IF IT PERHAPS DROPPD ALL CARDZ ALREADY. SETTIN DIS PROPERTY 2 LOW CAN RESULT IN EXCESIV AMOUNT OV STEAM REQUESTS BEAN SENT, WHILE SETTIN IT 2 HIGH CAN RESULT IN ASF STILL "FARMIN" GIVEN TITLE 4 UP 2 `FARMINGDELAY` MINUTEZ AFTR IZ FULLY FARMD. DEFAULT VALUE SHUD BE AWSUM 4 MOST USERS, BUT IF U HAS LOTZ DA BOTS RUNNIN, U CUD CONSIDR INCREASIN IT 2 SOMETHIN LIEK `30` MINUTEZ IN ORDR 2 LIMIT STEAM REQUESTS BEAN SENT. IZ NICE 2 NOWT DAT ASF USEZ EVENT-BASD MECHANISM AN CHECKZ GAME BADGE PAEG ON EACH STEAM ITEM DROPPD, SO IN GENERAL **WE DOAN EVEN NED 2 CHECK IT IN FIXD TIEM INTERVALS**, BUT AS WE DOAN FULLY TRUST STEAM NETWORK - WE CHECK GAME BADGE PAEG ANYWAY, IF WE DIDNT CHECK IT THRU CARD BEAN DROPPD EVENT IN LAST `FARMINGDELAY` MINUTEZ (IN CASE STEAM NETWORK DIDNT INFORM US BOUT ITEM DROPPD OR STUFF LIEK DAT). ASSUMIN DAT STEAM NETWORK IZ WERKIN PROPERLY, DECREASIN DIS VALUE **WILL NOT IMPROOOV FARMIN EFFICIENCY IN ANY WAI**, WHILE **INCREASIN NETWORK OVERHEAD SIGNIFICANTLY** - IZ RECOMMENDD ONLY 2 INCREASE IT (IF NEEDD) FRUM DEFAULT OV `15` MINUTEZ. UNLES U HAS **STRONG** REASON 2 EDIT DIS PROPERTY, U SHUD KEEP IT AT DEFAULT.

* * *

### `GIFTSLIMITERDELAY`

`BYTE` TYPE WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `1`. ASF WILL ENSURE DAT THAR WILL BE AT LEAST `GIFTSLIMITERDELAY` SECONDZ IN TWEEN OV 2 CONSECUTIV GIFT/KEY/LICENSE HANDLIN (REDEEMIN) REQUESTS 2 AVOID TRIGGERIN RATE-LIMIT. IN ADDISHUN 2 DAT ITLL ALSO BE USD AS GLOBAL LIMITR 4 GAME LIST REQUESTS, SUCH AS TEH WAN ISSUD BY `OWNS` **<A HREF="https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands">COMMAND</A>**. UNLES U HAS **STRONG** REASON 2 EDIT DIS PROPERTY, U SHUD KEEP IT AT DEFAULT.

* * *

### `HEADLES`

`BOOL` TYPE WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `FALSE`. DIS PROPERTY DEFINEZ IF PROCES SHUD RUN IN HEADLES MODE. WHEN IN HEADLES MODE, ASF ASSUMEZ DAT IZ RUNNIN ON SERVR OR IN OTHR NON-INTERACTIV ENVIRONMENT, THEREFORE IT WILL NOT ATTEMPT 2 READ ANY INFORMASHUN THRU CONSOLE INPUT. THIS INCLUDES ON-DEMAND DETAILS (ACCOUNT CREDENTIALS SUCH AS 2FA CODE, STEAMGUARD CODE, PASSWORD OR ANY OTHER VARIABLE REQUIRED FOR ASF TO OPERATE) AS WELL AS ALL OTHER CONSOLE INPUTS (SUCH AS INTERACTIVE COMMAND CONSOLE). IN OTHR WERDZ, `HEADLES` MODE IZ EQUAL 2 MAKIN ASF CONSOLE READ-ONLY. DIS SETTIN IZ USEFUL MAINLY 4 USERS RUNNIN ASF ON THEIR SERVERS, AS INSTEAD OV ASKIN E.G. 4 2FA CODE, ASF WILL SILENTLY ABORT TEH OPERASHUN BY STOPPIN AN AKOWNT. UNLES URE RUNNIN ASF ON SERVR, AN U PREVIOUSLY CONFIRMD DAT ASF IZ ABLE 2 OPERATE IN NON-HEADLES MODE, U SHUD KEEP DIS PROPERTY DISABLD. ANY USR INTERACSHUN WILL BE DENID WHEN IN HEADLES MODE, AN UR ACCOUNTS WILL NOT RUN IF THEY REQUIRE **ANY** CONSOLE INPUT DURIN STARTIN. DIS AR TEH USEFUL 4 SERVERS, AS ASF CAN ABORT TRYIN 2 LOG ONTO TEH AKOWNT WHEN ASKD 4 CREDENTIALS, INSTEAD OV WAITIN (INFINITELY) 4 USR 2 PROVIDE DOSE. ENABLIN DIS MODE WILL ALSO ALLOW U 2 USE `INPUT` **<A HREF="https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands">COMMAND</A>** WHICH ACTS AS REPLACEMENT 4 STANDARD CONSOLE INPUT. IF URE NOT SURE HOW 2 SET DIS PROPERTY, LEEF IT WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `FALSE`.

IF URE RUNNIN ASF ON TEH SERVR, U PROBABLY WANTS 2 USE DIS OPSHUN TOGETHR WIF `--PROCES-REQUIRD` **<A HREF="https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Command-line-arguments">COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENT</A>**.

* * *

### `IDLEFARMINGPERIOD`

`BYTE` TYPE WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `8`. WHEN ASF HAS NOTHIN 2 FARM, IT WILL PERIODICALLY CHECK EVRY `IDLEFARMINGPERIOD` HOURS IF PERHAPS AKOWNT GOT SUM NEW GAMEZ 2 FARM. DIS FEACHUR IZ NOT NEEDD WHEN TALKIN BOUT NEW GAMEZ WERE GETTIN, AS ASF IZ SMART ENOUGH 2 AUTOMATICALLY CHECK BADGE PAGEZ IN DIS CASE. `IDLEFARMINGPERIOD` IZ MAINLY 4 SITUASHUNS SUCH AS OLD GAMEZ WE ALREADY HAS HAVIN TRADIN CARDZ ADDD. IN DIS CASE THAR IZ NO EVENT, SO ASF HAS 2 PERIODICALLY CHECK BADGE PAGEZ IF WE WANTS 2 HAS DIS COVERD. VALUE OV `0` DISABLEZ DIS FEACHUR. ALSO CHECK: `SHUTDOWNONFARMINGFINISHD`.

* * *

### `InventoryLimiterDelay`

`BYTE` TYPE WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `3`. ASF WILL ENSURE DAT THAR WILL BE AT LEAST `INVENTORYLIMITERDELAY` SECONDZ IN TWEEN OV 2 CONSECUTIV INVENTORY REQUESTS 2 AVOID TRIGGERIN RATE-LIMIT - DOSE R BEAN USD 4 FETCHIN STEAM INVENTORIEZ, ESPECIALLY DURIN UR OWN COMMANDZ SUCH AS `TRANZFR`, AS WELL AS IN FEATUREZ LIEK `MATCHACTIVELY`. DEFAULT VALUE OV `3` WUZ SET BASD ON FETCHIN INVENTORIEZ OV OVAR 100 CONSECUTIV BOT INSTANCEZ, AN SHUD SATISFY MOST (IF NOT ALL) OV TEH USERS. U CUD HOWEVR WANTS 2 DECREASE IT, OR EVEN CHANGE 2 `0` IF U HAS VRY LOW AMOUNT OV BOTS, SO ASF WILL IGNORE TEH DELAY AN LOOT STEAM INVENTORIEZ MUTCH FASTR. BE WARND THOUGH, AS SETTIN IT 2 LOW **WILL** RESULT IN STEAM TEMPORARILY BANNIN UR IP, AN DAT WILL PREVENT U FRUM FETCHIN UR INVENTORY AT ALL. U ALSO CUD NED 2 INCREASE DIS VALUE IF URE RUNNIN LOT OV BOTS WIF LOT OV INVENTORY REQUESTS, ALTHOUGH IN DIS CASE U SHUD PROBABLY TRY 2 LIMIT NUMBR OV DOSE REQUESTS INSTEAD. UNLES U HAS **STRONG** REASON 2 EDIT DIS PROPERTY, U SHUD KEEP IT AT DEFAULT.

* * *

### `IPC`

`BOOL` TYPE WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `FALSE`. DIS PROPERTY DEFINEZ IF ASFS **<A HREF="https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/IPC">IPC</A>** SERVR SHUD START TOGETHR WIF TEH PROCES. IPC ALLOWS 4 INTR-PROCES COMMUNICASHUN BY BOOTIN LOCAL HTTP SERVR. IF URE NOT GOIN 2 MAK USE OV ASFS IPC SERVR, DEN THAR IZ NO REASON 4 U 2 ENABLE DIS OPSHUN.

* * *

### `IPCPassword`

`STRIN` TYPE WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `NULL`. DIS PROPERTY DEFINEZ MANDATORY PASWORD 4 EVRY API CALL DUN VIA IPC AN SERVEZ AS AN EXTRA SECURITY MEASURE. WHEN SET 2 NON-EMPTY VALUE, ALL IPC REQUESTS WILL REQUIRE EXTRA `PASWORD` PROPERTY SET 2 TEH PASWORD SPECIFID HER. DEFAULT VALUE OV `NULL` WILL SKIP NED OV TEH PASWORD, MAKIN ASF RESPECT ALL QUERIEZ. IN ADDISHUN 2 DAT, ENABLIN DIS OPSHUN ALSO ENABLEZ BUILT-IN IPC ANTI-BRUTEFORCE MECHANISM WHICH WILL TEMPORARILY BAN GIVEN `IPADDRES` AFTR SENDIN 2 LOTZ DA UNAUTHORIZD REQUESTS IN VRY SHORT TIEM. UNLES U HAS REASON 2 EDIT DIS PROPERTY, U SHUD KEEP IT AT DEFAULT.

* * *

### `IPCPasswordFormat`

`BYTE` TYPE WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `0`. DIS PROPERTY DEFINEZ TEH FORMAT OV `IPCPASWORD` PROPERTY AN USEZ `EHASHINGMETHOD` AS UNDERLYIN TYPE. PLZ REFR 2 **<A HREF="https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Security">SECURITY</A>** SECSHUN IF U WANTS 2 LERN MOAR, AS ULL NED 2 ENSURE DAT `IPCPASWORD` PROPERTY INDED INCLUDEZ PASWORD IN MATCHIN `IPCPASWORDFORMAT`. IN OTHR WERDZ, WHEN U CHANGE `IPCPASWORDFORMAT` DEN UR `IPCPASWORD` SHUD BE **ALREADY** IN DAT FORMAT, NOT JUS AIMIN 2 BE. UNLES U KNOE WUT URE DOIN, U SHUD KEEP IT WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `0`.

* * *

### `LoginLimiterDelay`

`BYTE` TYPE WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `10`. ASF WILL ENSURE DAT THAR WILL BE AT LEAST `LOGINLIMITERDELAY` SECONDZ IN TWEEN OV 2 CONSECUTIV CONNECSHUN ATTEMPTS 2 AVOID TRIGGERIN RATE-LIMIT.

CURRENTLY ASF SUPPORTS 3 UPDATE CHANNELS - `0` WHICH IZ CALLD `NONE`, `1`, WHICH IZ CALLD `STABLE`, AN `2`, WHICH IZ CALLD `EXPERIMENTAL`. `STABLE` CHANNEL IZ TEH DEFAULT RELEASE CHANNEL, WHICH SHUD BE USD BY MAJORITY OV USERS. `EXPERIMENTAL` CHANNEL IN ADDISHUN 2 `STABLE` RELEASEZ, ALSO INCLUDEZ **PRE-RELEASEZ** DEDICATD 4 ADVANCD USERS AN OTHR DEVELOPERS IN ORDR 2 TEST NEW FEATUREZ, CONFIRM BUGFIXEZ OR GIV FEEDBACK BOUT PLANND ENHANCEMENTS. **EXPERIMENTAL VERSHUNS OFTEN CONTAIN UNPATCHD BUGS, WERK-IN-PROGRES FEATUREZ OR REWRITTEN IMPLEMENTASHUNS**.

**UNLES U KNOE WUT URE DOIN**, WE **STRONGLY** RECOMMEND 2 KEEP IT AT DEFAULT.

* * *

### `UpdatePeriod`

`byte` type with default value of `24`. This property defines how often ASF should check for auto-updates. Updates are crucial not only to receive new features and critical security patches, but also to receive bugfixes, performance enhancements, stability improvements and more. When a value greater than `0` is set, ASF will automatically download, replace, and restart itself (if `AutoRestart` permits) when new update is available. In order to achieve this, ASF will check every `UpdatePeriod` hours if new update is available on our GitHub repo. A value of `0` disables auto-updates, but still allows you to execute `update` command manually. You may also be interested in setting appropriate `UpdateChannel` that `UpdatePeriod` should follow.

Update process of ASF involves update of entire folder structure that ASF is using, but without touching your own configs or databases located in `config` directory - this means that any extra files unrelated to ASF in its directory can be lost during update. Default value of `24` is a good balance between unnecessary checks, and ASF that is fresh enough.

Unless you have a **strong** reason to disable this feature, you should keep auto-updates enabled within reasonable `UpdatePeriod` **for your own good**. This is not only because we don't support anything but latest stable ASF release, but also because **we give our security guarantee only for latest version**. If you're using outdated ASF version then you're intentionally exposing yourself to all kind of issues, from small bugs, through broken functionality, ending with **[permanent Steam account suspensions](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/FAQ#did-somebody-get-banned-for-it)**, so we **strongly recommend**, for your own good, to always ensure that your ASF version is up to date. Auto-updates allow us to react quickly to all kind of issues by disabling or patching problematic code before it can escalate - if you opt out of it, you lose all of our security guarantees and risk consequences from running code that could be potentially harmful, not only to Steam network, but also (by definition) to your own Steam account.

* * *

### `WebLimiterDelay`

`ushort` type with default value of `300`. This property defines, in miliseconds, the minimum amount of delay between sending two consecutive requests to the same Steam web-service. Such delay is required as **[AkamaiGhost](https://www.akamai.com)** service that Steam uses internally includes rate-limiting based on global number of requests sent across given time period. In normal circumstances akamai block is rather hard to achieve, but under very heavy workloads with a huge ongoing queue of requests, it's possible to trigger it if we keep sending too many requests across too short time period.

Default value was set based on assumption that ASF is the only tool accessing Steam web-services, in particular `steamcommunity.com`, `api.steampowered.com` and `store.steampowered.com`. If you're using other tools sending requests to the same web-services then you should make sure that your tool includes similar functionality of `WebLimiterDelay` and set both to double of default value, which would be `600`. This guarantees that under no circumstance you'll exceed sending more than 1 request per `300` ms.

In general, lowering `WebLimiterDelay` under default value is **strongly discouraged** as it could lead to various IP-related blocks, some of which are possible to be permanent. Default value is good enough for running a single ASF instance on the server, as well as using ASF in normal scenario along with original Steam client. It should be correct for majority of usages, and you should only increase it (never lower it), if - apart from using ASF, you're also using another tool that may send excessive number of requests to the same web-services that ASF is making use of. In short, global number of all requests sent from a single IP to a single Steam domain should never exceed more than 1 request per `300` ms.

UNLES U HAS REASON 2 EDIT DIS PROPERTY, U SHUD KEEP IT AT DEFAULT.

* * *

### `WebProxy`

`string` type with default value of `null`. This property defines a web proxy address that will be used for all internal http and https requests sent by ASF's `HttpClient`, especially to services such as `github.com`, `steamcommunity.com` and `store.steampowered.com`. Proxying ASF requests in general has no advantages, but it's exceptionally useful for bypassing various kinds of firewalls, especially the great firewall in China.

This property is defined as uri string:

> A URI string is composed of a scheme (http or https), a host, and an optional port. An example of a complete uri string is `"http://contoso.com:8080"`.

If your proxy requires user authentication, you will also need to set up `WebProxyUsername` and/or `WebProxyPassword`. If there is no such need, setting up this property alone is sufficient.

Right now ASF uses web proxy only for `http` and `https` requests, which **do not** include internal Steam network communication done within ASF's internal Steam client. There are currently no plans for supporting that, mainly due to missing **[SK2](https://github.com/SteamRE/SteamKit/issues/587#issuecomment-413271550)** functionality. If you need/want it to happen, I'd suggest starting from there.

UNLES U HAS REASON 2 EDIT DIS PROPERTY, U SHUD KEEP IT AT DEFAULT.

* * *

### `WebProxyPassword`

`string` type with default value of `null`. This property defines password field used in basic, digest, NTLM, and Kerberos authentication that is supported by a target `WebProxy` machine providing proxy functionality. If your proxy doesn't require user credentials, there is no need for you to input anything here. Using this option makes sense only if `WebProxy` is used as well, as it has no effect otherwise.

UNLES U HAS REASON 2 EDIT DIS PROPERTY, U SHUD KEEP IT AT DEFAULT.

* * *

### `WebProxyUsername`

`string` type with default value of `null`. This property defines username field used in basic, digest, NTLM, and Kerberos authentication that is supported by a target `WebProxy` machine providing proxy functionality. If your proxy doesn't require user credentials, there is no need for you to input anything here. Using this option makes sense only if `WebProxy` is used as well, as it has no effect otherwise.

UNLES U HAS REASON 2 EDIT DIS PROPERTY, U SHUD KEEP IT AT DEFAULT.

## Bot config

As you should know already, every bot should have its own config based on example JSON structure below. Start from deciding how you want to name your bot (e.g. `1.json`, `main.json`, `primary.json` or `AnythingElse.json`) and head over to configuration.

**Notice:** Bot can't be named `ASF` (as that keyword is reserved for global config), ASF will also ignore all configuration files starting with a dot.

The bot config has following structure:

```json
{
    "AcceptGifts": false,
    "AutoSteamSaleEvent": false,
    "BotBehaviour": 0,
    "CompleteTypesToSend": [],
    "CustomGamePlayedWhileFarming": null,
    "CustomGamePlayedWhileIdle": null,
    "Enabled": false,
    "FarmingOrders": [],
    "GamesPlayedWhileIdle": [],
    "HoursUntilCardDrops": 3,
    "IdlePriorityQueueOnly": false,
    "IdleRefundableGames": true,
    "LootableTypes": [1, 3, 5],
    "MatchableTypes": [5],
    "OnlineStatus": 1,
    "PasswordFormat": 0,
    "Paused": false,
    "RedeemingPreferences": 0,
    "SendOnFarmingFinished": false,
    "SendTradePeriod": 0,
    "ShutdownOnFarmingFinished": false,
    "SteamLogin": null,
    "SteamMasterClanID": 0,
    "SteamParentalCode": null,
    "SteamPassword": null,
    "SteamTradeToken": null,
    "SteamUserPermissions": {},
    "TradingPreferences": 0,
    "TransferableTypes": [1, 3, 5],
    "UseLoginKeys": true,
    "UserInterfaceMode": 0
}
```

* * *

ALL OPSHUNS R EXPLAIND BELOW:

### `AcceptGifts`

`BOOL` TYPE WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `FALSE`. When enabled, ASF will automatically accept and redeem all steam gifts (including wallet gift cards) sent to the bot. This includes also gifts sent from users other than those defined in `SteamUserPermissions`. Keep in mind that gifts sent to e-mail address are not directly forwarded to the client, so ASF won't accept those without your help.

This option is recommended only for alt accounts, as it's very likely that you don't want to automatically redeem all gifts sent to your primary account. If you're unsure whether you want this feature enabled or not, keep it with default value of `false`.

* * *

### `AutoSteamSaleEvent`

`BOOL` TYPE WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `FALSE`. During Steam summer/winter sale events Steam is known for providing you extra cards for browsing discovery queue each day, as well as through other event-specific activities. When this option is enabled, ASF will automatically check Steam discovery queue each `8` hours (starting in one hour since program start), and clear it if needed. This option is not recommended if you want to do that action yourself, and typically it should make sense only on bot accounts. Moreover, you need to ensure that your account is at least of level `8` if you expect to receive those cards in the first place, which comes directly as Steam requirement. If you're unsure whether you want this feature enabled or not, keep it with default value of `false`.

Please note that due to constant Valve issues, changes and problems, **we give no guarantee whether this function will work properly**, therefore it's entirely possible that this option **will not work at all**. We do not accept **any** bug reports, neither support requests for this option. It's offered with absolutely no guarantees, you're using it at your own risk.

* * *

### `BotBehaviour`

`byte flags` type with default value of `0`. This property defines ASF bot-like behaviour during various events, and is defined as below:

| VALUE | Name                          | DESCRIPSHUN                                                                                              |
| ----- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | None                          | No special bot behaviour, the least invasive mode, default                                               |
| 1     | RejectInvalidFriendInvites    | Will cause ASF to reject (instead of ignoring) invalid friend invites                                    |
| 2     | RejectInvalidTrades           | Will cause ASF to reject (instead of ignoring) invalid trade offers                                      |
| 4     | RejectInvalidGroupInvites     | Will cause ASF to reject (instead of ignoring) invalid group invites                                     |
| 8     | DismissInventoryNotifications | Will cause ASF to automatically dismiss all inventory notifications                                      |
| 16    | MarkReceivedMessagesAsRead    | Will cause ASF to automatically mark all received messages as read                                       |
| 32    | MarkBotMessagesAsRead         | Will cause ASF to automatically mark messages from other ASF bots (running in the same instance) as read |

PLZ NOTICE DAT DIS PROPERTY IZ `FLAGS` FIELD, THEREFORE IZ POSIBLE 2 CHOOSE ANY COMBINASHUN OV AVAILABLE VALUEZ. CHECK OUT **<A HREF="#json-mappin">FLAGS MAPPIN</A>** IF UD LIEK 2 LERN MOAR. Not enabling any of flags results in `None` option.

In general you want to modify this property if you expect from ASF to do certain amount of automation related to its activity, as it'd be expected from a bot account, but not a primary account used in ASF. Therefore, changing this property makes sense mainly for alt accounts, although you're free to use selected options for main accounts as well.

Normal (`None`) ASF behaviour is to only automate things that user wants (e.g. cards farming or `SteamTradeMatcher` offers, if set in `TradingPreferences`). This is the least invasive mode, and it's beneficial to majority of users since you remain in full control over your account and you can decide yourself whether to allow certain out-of-scope interactions, or not.

Invalid friend invite is an invite that doesn't come from user with `FamilySharing` permission (defined in `SteamUserPermissions`) or above. ASF in normal mode ignores those invites, as you'd expect, giving you free choice whether to accept them, or not. `RejectInvalidFriendInvites` will cause those invites to be automatically rejected, which will practically disable option for other people to add you to their friend list (as ASF will deny all such requests, apart from people defined in `SteamUserPermissions`). Unless you want to outright deny all friend invites, you shouldn't enable this option.

Invalid trade offer is an offer that isn't accepted through built-in ASF module. More on this matter can be found in **[trading](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Trading)** section which explicitly defines what types of trade ASF is willing to accept automatically. Valid trades are also defined by other settings, especially `TradingPreferences`. `RejectInvalidTrades` will cause all invalid trade offers to be rejected, instead of being ignored. Unless you want to outright deny all trade offers that aren't automatically accepted by ASF, you shouldn't enable this option.

Invalid group invite is an invite that doesn't come from `SteamMasterClanID` group. ASF in normal mode ignores those group invites, as you'd expect, allowing you to decide yourself if you want to join particular Steam group or not. `RejectInvalidGroupInvites` will cause all those group invites to be automatically rejected, effectively making it impossible to invite you to any other group than `SteamMasterClanID`. Unless you want to outright deny all group invites, you shouldn't enable this option.

`DismissInventoryNotifications` is extremely useful when you start getting annoyed by constant Steam notification about receiving new items. ASF can't get rid of the notification itself, as that's built-in into your Steam client, but it's able to automatically clear the notification after receiving it, which will no longer leave "new items in inventory" notification hanging around. If you expect to evaluate yourself all received items (especially cards idled with ASF), then naturally you shouldn't enable this option. When you start going crazy, remember this is offered as an option.

`MarkReceivedMessagesAsRead` will automatically mark **all** messages being received by the account on which ASF is running, both private and group, as read. This typically should be used by alt accounts only in order to clear "new message" notification coming e.g. from you during executing ASF commands. We do not recommend this option for primary accounts, unless you want to cut yourself from any kind of new messages notifications, **including** those that happened while you were offline, assuming that ASF was still left open dismissing it.

`MarkBotMessagesAsRead` works in a similar manner by marking only bot messages as read. However, keep in mind that when using that option on group chats with your bots and other people, Steam implementation of acknowledging chat message **also** acknowledges all messages that happened **before** the one you decided to mark, so if by any chance you don't want to miss unrelated message that happened in-between, you typically want to avoid using this feature. Obviously, it's also risky when you have multiple primary accounts (e.g. from different users) running in the same ASF instance, as you can also miss their normal out-of-ASF messages.

If you're unsure how to configure this option, it's best to leave it at default.

* * *

### `CompleteTypesToSend`

`ImmutableHashSet<byte>` type with default value of being empty. When ASF is done with completing a given set of item types specified here, it can automatically send steam trade with all finished sets to the user with `Master` permission, which is very convenient if you'd like to utilize given bot account for e.g. STM matching, while moving finished sets to some other account. This option works the same as `loot` command, therefore keep in mind that it requires user with `Master` permission set, you may also need a valid `SteamTradeToken`, as well as using an account that is eligible for trading in the first place.

As of today, the following item types are supported in this setting:

| VALUE | Name            | DESCRIPSHUN                                                   |
| ----- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3     | FoilTradingCard | Foil variant of `TradingCard`                                 |
| 5     | TradingCard     | Steam trading card, being used for crafting badges (non-foil) |

Please note that regardless of the settings above, ASF will only ask for Steam (`appID` of 753) community (`contextID` of 6) items, so all game items, gifts and likewise, are excluded from the trade offer by definition.

Due to additional overhead of using this option, it's recommended to use it only on bot accounts that have a realistic chance of finishing sets on their own - for example, it makes no sense to activate if you're already using `SendOnFarmingFinished`, `SendTradePeriod` or `loot` command on usual basis.

If you're unsure how to configure this option, it's best to leave it at default.

* * *

### `CustomGamePlayedWhileFarming`

`string` type with default value of `null`. When ASF is farming, it can display itself as "Playing non-steam game: `CustomGamePlayedWhileFarming`" instead of currently farmed game. This can be useful if you would like to let your friends know that you're farming, yet you don't want to use `OnlineStatus` of `Offline`. Please note that ASF cannot guarantee the actual display order of Steam network, therefore this is only a suggestion that may, or may not, display properly. Default value of `null` disables this feature.

ASF provides a few special variables that you can optionally use in your text. `{0}` will be replaced by ASF with `AppID` of currently farmed game(s), while `{1}` will be replaced by ASF with `GameName` of currently farmed game(s).

* * *

### `CustomGamePlayedWhileIdle`

`string` type with default value of `null`. Similar to `CustomGamePlayedWhileFarming`, but for the situation when ASF has nothing to do (as account is fully farmed). Default value of `null` disables this feature.

* * *

### `Enabled`

`BOOL` TYPE WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `FALSE`. This property defines if bot is enabled. Enabled bot instance (`true`) will automatically start on ASF run, while disabled bot instance (`false`) will need to be started manually. By default every bot is disabled, so you probably want to switch this property to `true` for all of your bots that should be started automatically.

* * *

### `FarmingOrders`

`ImmutableList<byte>` type with default value of being empty. This property defines the **preferred** farming order used by ASF for given bot account. Currently there are following farming orders available:

| VALUE | Name                      | DESCRIPSHUN                                                                      |
| ----- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | Unordered                 | No sorting, slightly improving CPU performance                                   |
| 1     | AppIDsAscending           | Try to farm games with lowest `appIDs` first                                     |
| 2     | AppIDsDescending          | Try to farm games with highest `appIDs` first                                    |
| 3     | CardDropsAscending        | Try to farm games with lowest number of card drops remaining first               |
| 4     | CardDropsDescending       | Try to farm games with highest number of card drops remaining first              |
| 5     | HoursAscending            | Try to farm games with lowest number of hours played first                       |
| 6     | HoursDescending           | Try to farm games with highest number of hours played first                      |
| 7     | NamesAscending            | Try to farm games in alphabetical order, starting from A                         |
| 8     | NamesDescending           | Try to farm games in reverse alphabetical order, starting from Z                 |
| 9     | Random                    | Try to farm games in totally random order (different on each run of the program) |
| 10    | BadgeLevelsAscending      | Try to farm games with lowest badge levels first                                 |
| 11    | BadgeLevelsDescending     | Try to farm games with highest badge levels first                                |
| 12    | RedeemDateTimesAscending  | Try to farm oldest games on our account first                                    |
| 13    | RedeemDateTimesDescending | Try to farm newest games on our account first                                    |
| 14    | MarketableAscending       | Try to farm games with unmarketable card drops first                             |
| 15    | MarketableDescending      | Try to farm games with marketable card drops first                               |

Since this property is an array, it allows you to use several different settings in your fixed order. For example, you can include values of `15`, `11` and `7` in order to sort by marketable games first, then by those with highest badge level, and finally alphabetically. As you can guess, the order actually matters, as reverse one (`7`, `11` and `15`) achieves something entirely different. Majority of people will probably use just one order out of all of them, but in case you want to, you can also sort further by extra parameters.

Also notice the word "try" in all above descriptions - the actual ASF order is heavily affected by selected **[cards farming algorithm](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Performance)** and sorting will affect only results that ASF considers same performance-wise. For example, in `Simple` algorithm, selected `FarmingOrders` should be entirely respected in current farming session (as every game has the same performance value), while in `Complex` algorithm actual order is affected by hours first, and then sorted according to chosen `FarmingOrders`. This will lead to different results, as games with existing playtime will have a priority over others, so effectively ASF will prefer games that already passed required `HoursUntilCardDrops` firstly, and only then sorting those games further by your chosen `FarmingOrders`. Likewise, once ASF runs out of already-bumped games, it'll sort remaining queue by hours first (as that will decrease time required for bumping any of remaining titles to `HoursUntilCardDrops`). Therefore, this config property is only a **suggestion** that ASF will try to respect, as long as it doesn't affect performance negatively (in this case, ASF will always prefer idling performance over `FarmingOrders`).

There is also idling priority queue that is accessible through `iq` **[commands](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands)**. If it's used, actual idling order is sorted firstly by performance, then by idling queue, and finally by your `FarmingOrders`.

* * *

### `GamesPlayedWhileIdle`

`IMMUTABLEHASHSET<UINT>` TYPE WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV BEAN EMPTY. If ASF has nothing to farm it can play your specified steam games (`appIDs`) instead. Playing games in such manner increases your "hours played" of those games, but nothing else apart of it. In order for this feature to work properly, your Steam account **must** own a valid license to all the `appIDs` that you specify here, this includes F2P games as well. This feature can be enabled at the same time with `CustomGamePlayedWhileIdle` in order to play your selected games while showing custom status in Steam network, but in this case, like in `CustomGamePlayedWhileFarming` case, the actual display order is not guaranteed. Please note that Steam allows ASF to play only up to `32` `appIDs` total, therefore you can put only as many games in this property.

* * *

### `HoursUntilCardDrops`

`BYTE` TYPE WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `3`. This property defines if account has card drops restricted, and if yes, for how many initial hours. Restricted card drops means that account is not receiving any card drops from given game until the game is played for at least `HoursUntilCardDrops` hours. Unfortunately there is no magical way to detect that, so ASF relies on you. This property affects **[cards farming algorithm](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Performance)** that will be used. Setting this property properly will maximize profits and minimize time required for cards to be farmed. Remember that there is no obvious answer whether you should use one or another value, since it fully depends on your account. It seems that older accounts which never asked for refund have unrestricted card drops, so they should use a value of `0`, while new accounts and those who did ask for refund have restricted card drops with a value of `3`. DIS AR TEH HOWEVR ONLY THEORY, AN SHUD NOT BE TAKEN AS RULE. The default value for this property was set based on "lesser evil" and majority of use cases.

* * *

### `IdlePriorityQueueOnly`

`BOOL` TYPE WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `FALSE`. This property defines if ASF should consider for automatic idling only apps that you added yourself to priority idling queue available with `iq` **[commands](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands)**. When this option is enabled, ASF will skip all `appIDs` that are missing on the list, effectively allowing you to cherry-pick games for automatic ASF idling. Keep in mind that if you didn't add any games to the queue then ASF will act as if there is nothing to idle on your account. If you're unsure whether you want this feature enabled or not, keep it with default value of `false`.

* * *

### `IdleRefundableGames`

`BOOL` TYPE WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `TRUE`. This property defines if ASF is permitted to idle games that are still refundable. A refundable game is a game that you bought in last 2 weeks through Steam Store and didn't play for longer than 2 hours yet, as stated on **[Steam refunds](https://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds)** page. By default when this option is set to `true`, ASF ignores Steam refunds policy entirely and idles everything, as most people would expect. However, you can change this option to `false` if you want to ensure that ASF won't idle any of your refundable games too soon, allowing you to evaluate those games yourself and refund if needed without worrying about ASF affecting playtime negatively. Please note that if you disable this option then games you purchased from Steam Store won't be idled by ASF for up to 14 days since redeem date, which will show as nothing to idle if your account doesn't own anything else. If you're unsure whether you want this feature enabled or not, keep it with default value of `true`.

* * *

### `LootableTypes`

`ImmutableHashSet<byte>` type with default value of `1, 3, 5` steam item types. This property defines ASF behaviour when looting - both manual, using a **[command](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands)**, as well as automatic one, through one or more configuration properties. ASF will ensure that only items from `LootableTypes` will be included in a trade offer, therefore this property allows you to choose what you want to receive in a trade offer that is being sent to you.

| VALUE | Name                  | DESCRIPSHUN                                                   |
| ----- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | Unknown               | Every type that doesn't fit in any of the below               |
| 1     | BoosterPack           | Booster pack containing 3 random cards from a game            |
| 2     | Emoticon              | Emoticon to use in Steam Chat                                 |
| 3     | FoilTradingCard       | Foil variant of `TradingCard`                                 |
| 4     | ProfileBackground     | Profile background to use on your Steam profile               |
| 5     | TradingCard           | Steam trading card, being used for crafting badges (non-foil) |
| 6     | SteamGems             | Steam gems being used for crafting boosters, sacks included   |
| 7     | SaleItem              | Special items awarded during Steam sales                      |
| 8     | Consumable            | Special consumable items that disappear after being used      |
| 9     | ProfileModifier       | Special items that can modify Steam profile appearance        |
| 10    | Sticker               | Special items that can be used on Steam chat                  |
| 11    | ChatEffect            | Special items that can be used on Steam chat                  |
| 12    | MiniProfileBackground | Special background for Steam profile                          |
| 13    | AvatarProfileFrame    | Special avatar frame for Steam profile                        |
| 14    | AnimatedAvatar        | Special animated avatar for Steam profile                     |

Please note that regardless of the settings above, ASF will only ask for Steam (`appID` of 753) community (`contextID` of 6) items, so all game items, gifts and likewise, are excluded from the trade offer by definition.

Default ASF setting is based on the most common usage of the bot, with looting only booster packs, and trading cards (including foils). The property defined here allows you to alter that behaviour in whatever way that satisfies you. Please keep in mind that all types not defined above will show as `Unknown` type, which is especially important when Valve releases some new Steam item, that will be marked as `Unknown` by ASF as well, until it's added here (in the future release). That's why in general it's not recommended to include `Unknown` type in your `LootableTypes`, unless you know what you're doing, and you also understand that ASF will send your entire inventory in a trade offer if Steam Network gets broken again and reports all your items as `Unknown`. My strong suggestion is to not include `Unknown` type in the `LootableTypes`, even if you expect to loot everything (else).

* * *

### `MatchableTypes`

`ImmutableHashSet<byte>` type with default value of `5` Steam item types. This property defines which Steam item types are permitted to be matched when `SteamTradeMatcher` option in `TradingPreferences` is enabled. Types are defined as below:

| VALUE | Name                  | DESCRIPSHUN                                                   |
| ----- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | Unknown               | Every type that doesn't fit in any of the below               |
| 1     | BoosterPack           | Booster pack containing 3 random cards from a game            |
| 2     | Emoticon              | Emoticon to use in Steam Chat                                 |
| 3     | FoilTradingCard       | Foil variant of `TradingCard`                                 |
| 4     | ProfileBackground     | Profile background to use on your Steam profile               |
| 5     | TradingCard           | Steam trading card, being used for crafting badges (non-foil) |
| 6     | SteamGems             | Steam gems being used for crafting boosters, sacks included   |
| 7     | SaleItem              | Special items awarded during Steam sales                      |
| 8     | Consumable            | Special consumable items that disappear after being used      |
| 9     | ProfileModifier       | Special items that can modify Steam profile appearance        |
| 10    | Sticker               | Special items that can be used on Steam chat                  |
| 11    | ChatEffect            | Special items that can be used on Steam chat                  |
| 12    | MiniProfileBackground | Special background for Steam profile                          |
| 13    | AvatarProfileFrame    | Special avatar frame for Steam profile                        |
| 14    | AnimatedAvatar        | Special animated avatar for Steam profile                     |

Of course, types that you should use for this property typically include only `2`, `3`, `4` and `5`, as only those types are supported by STM. ASF includes proper logic for discovering rarity of the items, therefore it's also safe to match emoticons or backgrounds, as ASF will properly consider fair only those items from the same game and type, that also share the same rarity.

Please note that **ASF is not a trading bot** and **will NOT care about the market price**. If you don't consider items of the same rarity from the same set to be the same price-wise, then this option is NOT for you. Please evaluate twice if you understand and agree with this statement before you decide to change this setting.

Unless you know what you're doing, you should keep it with default value of `5`.

* * *

### `OnlineStatus`

`BYTE` TYPE WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `1`. This property specifies Steam community status that the bot will be announced with after logging in to Steam network. Currently you can choose one of below statuses:

| VALUE | Name           |
| ----- | -------------- |
| 0     | OFFLINE        |
| 1     | ONLINE         |
| 2     | Busy           |
| 3     | Away           |
| 4     | Snooze         |
| 5     | LookingToTrade |
| 6     | LookingToPlay  |
| 7     | Invisible      |

`Offline` status is extremely useful for primary accounts. As you should know, farming a game actually shows your steam status as "Playing game: XXX", which can be misleading to your friends, confusing them that you're playing a game while actually you're only farming it. Using `Offline` status solves that issue - your account will never be shown as "in-game" when you're farming steam cards with ASF. This is possible thanks to the fact that ASF does not have to sign in into Steam Community in order to work properly, so we're in fact playing those games, connected to Steam network, but without announcing our online presence at all. Keep in mind that played games using offline status will still count towards your playtime, and show as "recently played" on your profile.

In addition to that, this feature is also important if you want to receive notifications and unread messages when ASF is running, while not keeping Steam client open at the same time. This is because ASF acts as a Steam client itself, and whether ASF would like it or not, Steam broadcasts all those messages and other events to it. This is not a problem if you have both ASF and your own Steam client running, as both clients receive exactly the same events. However, if just ASF is running, Steam network could mark certain events and messages as "delivered", despite of your traditional Steam client not receiving it due to not being present. Offline status also solves this problem, as ASF is never considered for any community events in this case, so all unread messages and other events will be properly marked as unread when you come back.

It's important to note that ASF running on `Offline` mode will **not** be able to receive commands in usual Steam chat way, as the chat, as well as entire community presence is in fact, entirely offline. A solution to this issue is using `Invisible` mode instead which works in a similar way (not exposing status), but keeps the ability to receive and respond to messages (so also a potential to dismiss notifications and unread messages as stated above). `Invisible` mode makes the most sense on alt accounts that you don't want to expose (status-wise), but still be able to send commands to.

However, there is one catch with `Invisible` mode - it doesn't go well with primary accounts. This is because **any** Steam session that is currently online **exposes** the status, even if ASF itself does not. This is caused by the current limitation/bug of the Steam network that isn't possible to be fixed on ASF side, so if you want to use `Invisible` mode you will also need to ensure that **all** other sessions to the same account use `Invisible` mode as well. This will be the case on alt accounts where ASF is hopefully the only active session, but on primary accounts you'll almost always prefer to show as `Online` to your friends, hiding only ASF activity, and in this case `Invisible` mode will be entirely useless for you (we recommend to use `Offline` mode instead). Hopefully this limitation/bug will be eventually solved in the future by Valve, but I wouldn't expect that to happen anytime soon...

If you're unsure how to set up this property, it's recommended to use a value of `0` (`Offline`) for primary accounts, and default `1` (`Online`) otherwise.

* * *

### `PasswordFormat`

`BYTE` TYPE WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `0`. This property defines the format of `SteamPassword` property, and currently supports - `0` for `PlainText`, `1` for `AES` and `2` for `ProtectedDataForCurrentUser`. Please refer to **[Security](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Security)** section if you want to learn more, as you'll need to ensure that `SteamPassword` property indeed includes password in matching `PasswordFormat`. In other words, when you change `PasswordFormat` then your `SteamPassword` should be **already** in that format, not just aiming to be. UNLES U KNOE WUT URE DOIN, U SHUD KEEP IT WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `0`.

* * *

### `Paused`

`BOOL` TYPE WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `FALSE`. This property defines initial state of `CardsFarmer` module. With default value of `false`, bot will automatically start farming when it's started, either because of `Enabled` or `start` command. Switching this property to `true` should be done only if you want to manually `resume` automatic farming process, for example because you want to use `play` all the time and never use automatic `CardsFarmer` module - this works exactly the same as `pause` **[command](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands)**. If you're unsure whether you want this feature enabled or not, keep it with default value of `false`.

* * *

### `RedeemingPreferences`

`byte flags` type with default value of `0`. This property defines ASF behaviour when redeeming cd-keys, and is defined as below:

| VALUE | Name                               | DESCRIPSHUN                                                                                                                     |
| ----- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | None                               | No special redeeming preferences, default                                                                                       |
| 1     | Forwarding                         | Forward keys unavailable to redeem to other bots                                                                                |
| 2     | Distributing                       | Distribute all keys among itself and other bots                                                                                 |
| 4     | KeepMissingGames                   | Keep keys for (potentially) missing games when forwarding, leaving them unused                                                  |
| 8     | AssumeWalletKeyOnBadActivationCode | Assume that `BadActivationCode` keys are equal to `CannotRedeemCodeFromClient`, and therefore try to redeem them as wallet keys |

PLZ NOTICE DAT DIS PROPERTY IZ `FLAGS` FIELD, THEREFORE IZ POSIBLE 2 CHOOSE ANY COMBINASHUN OV AVAILABLE VALUEZ. CHECK OUT **<A HREF="#json-mappin">FLAGS MAPPIN</A>** IF UD LIEK 2 LERN MOAR. Not enabling any of flags results in `None` option.

`Forwarding` will cause bot to forward a key that is not possible to redeem, to another connected and logged on bot that is missing that particular game (if possible to check). The most common situation is forwarding `AlreadyPurchased` game to another bot that is missing that particular game, but this option also covers other scenarios, such as `DoesNotOwnRequiredApp`, `RateLimited` or `RestrictedCountry`.

`Distributing` will cause bot to distribute all received keys among itself and other bots. This means that every bot will get a single key from the batch. Typically this is used only when you're redeeming many keys for the same game, and you want to evenly distribute them among your bots, as opposed to redeeming keys for various different games. This feature makes no sense if you're redeeming only one key in a single `redeem` action (as there are no extra keys to be distributed).

`KeepMissingGames` will cause bot to skip `Forwarding` when we can't be sure if key being redeemed is in fact owned by our bot, or not. This basically means that `Forwarding` will apply **only** to `AlreadyPurchased` keys, instead of covering also other cases such as `DoesNotOwnRequiredApp`, `RateLimited` or `RestrictedCountry`. Typically you want to use this option on primary account, to ensure that keys being redeemed on it won't be forwarded further if your bot for example becomes temporarily `RateLimited`. As you can guess from the description, this field has absolutely no effect if `Forwarding` is not enabled.

`AssumeWalletKeyOnBadActivationCode` will cause `BadActivationCode` keys to be treated as `CannotRedeemCodeFromClient`, and therefore result in ASF trying to redeem them as wallet keys. This is needed because Steam might announce wallet keys as `BadActivationCode` (and not `CannotRedeemCodeFromClient` as it used to), resulting in ASF never attempting to redeem them. However, we recommend **against** using this preference, as it'll result in ASF trying to redeem every invalid key as a wallet code, resulting in excessive amount of (potentially invalid) requests sent to the Steam service, with all the potential consequences. Instead, we recommend to use `ForceAssumeWalletKey` **[`redeem^`](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands#redeem-modes)** mode while knowingly redeeming wallet keys, which will enable the needed workaround only when it's required, on as-needed basis.

Enabling both `Forwarding` and `Distributing` will add distributing feature on top of forwarding one, which makes ASF trying to redeem one key on all bots firstly (forwarding) before moving to the next one (distributing). Typically you want to use this option only when you want `Forwarding`, but with altered behaviour of switching the bot on key being used, instead of always going in-order with every key (which would be `Forwarding` alone). This behaviour can be beneficial if you know that majority or even all of your keys are tied to the same game, because in this situation `Forwarding` alone would try to redeem everything on one bot firstly (which makes sense if your keys are for unique games), and `Forwarding` + `Distributing` will switch the bot on the next key, "distributing" the task of redeeming new key onto another bot than the initial one (which makes sense if keys are for the same game, skipping one pointless attempt per key).

The actual bots order for all of the redeeming scenarios is alphabetical, excluding bots that are unavailable (not connected, stopped or likewise). Please keep in mind that there is per-IP and per-account hourly limit of redeeming tries, and every redeem try that didn't end with `OK` contributes to failed tries. ASF will do its best to minimize number of `AlreadyPurchased` failures, e.g. by trying to avoid forwarding a key to another bot that already owns that particular game, but it's not always guaranteed to work due to how Steam is handling licenses. Using redeeming flags such as `Forwarding` or `Distributing` will always increase your likelyhood to hit `RateLimited`.

Also keep in mind that you can't forward or distribute keys to bots that you do not have access to. This should be obvious, but ensure that you're at least `Operator` of all the bots you want to include in your redeeming process, for example with `status ASF` **[command](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands)**.

* * *

### `SendOnFarmingFinished`

`BOOL` TYPE WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `FALSE`. When ASF is done with farming given account, it can automatically send steam trade containing everything farmed up to this point to user with `Master` permission, which is very convenient if you don't want to bother with trades yourself. This option works the same as `loot` command, therefore keep in mind that it requires user with `Master` permission set, you may also need a valid `SteamTradeToken`, as well as using an account that is eligible for trading in the first place. In addition to initiating `loot` after finishing farming, ASF will also initiate `loot` on each new items notification (when not farming), and after completing each trade that results in new items (always) when this option is active. This is especially useful for "forwarding" items received from other people to our account.

Typically you'll want to use **[ASF 2FA](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Two-factor-authentication)** together with this feature, although it's not a requirement if you intend to confirm manually in timely fashion. IF URE NOT SURE HOW 2 SET DIS PROPERTY, LEEF IT WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `FALSE`.

* * *

### `SendTradePeriod`

`BYTE` TYPE WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `0`. This property works very similar to `SendOnFarmingFinished` property, with one difference - instead of sending trade when farming is done, we can also send it every `SendTradePeriod` hours, regardless of how much we have to farm left. This is useful if you want to `loot` your alt accounts on usual basis instead of waiting for it to finish farming. Default value of `0` disables this feature, if you want your bot to send you trade e.g. every day, you should put `24` here.

Typically you'll want to use **[ASF 2FA](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Two-factor-authentication)** together with this feature, although it's not a requirement if you intend to confirm manually in timely fashion. If you're not sure how to set this property, leave it with default value of `0`.

* * *

### `ShutdownOnFarmingFinished`

`BOOL` TYPE WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `FALSE`. ASF is "occupying" an account for the whole time of process being active. When given account is done with farming, ASF periodically checks it (every `IdleFarmingPeriod` hours), if perhaps some new games with steam cards were added in the meantime, so it can resume farming of that account without a need to restart the process. This is useful for majority of people, as ASF can automatically resume farming when needed. However, you may actually want to stop the process when given account is fully farmed, you can achieve that by setting this property to `true`. When enabled, ASF will proceed with logging off when account is fully farmed, which means that it won't be periodically checked or occupied anymore. You should decide yourself if you prefer ASF to work on given bot instance for the whole time, or if perhaps ASF should stop it when farming process is done. When all accounts are stopped and process is not running in `--process-required` **[mode](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Command-Line-Arguments)**, ASF will shutdown as well, putting your machine at rest and allowing you to schedule other actions, such as sleep or shutdown at the same moment of last card dropping.

IF URE NOT SURE HOW 2 SET DIS PROPERTY, LEEF IT WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `FALSE`.

* * *

### `SteamLogin`

`string` type with default value of `null`. This property defines your steam login - the one you use for logging in to steam. In addition to defining steam login here, you may also keep default value of `null` if you want to enter your steam login on each ASF startup instead of putting it in the config. This may be useful for you if you don't want to save sensitive data in config file.

* * *

### `SteamMasterClanID`

`ULONG` TYPE WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `0`. This property defines the steamID of the steam group that bot should automatically join, including its group chat. You can check steamID of your group by navigating to its **[page](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/archiasf)**, then adding `/memberslistxml?xml=1` to the end of the link, so the link will look like **[this](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/archiasf/memberslistxml?xml=1)**. Then you can get steamID of your group from the result, it's in `<groupID64>` tag. In above example it would be `103582791440160998`. In addition to trying to join given group at startup, the bot will also automatically accept group invites to this group, which makes it possible for you to invite your bot manually if your group has private membership. If you don't have any group dedicated for your bots, you should keep this property with default value of `0`.

* * *

### `SteamParentalCode`

`string` type with default value of `null`. This property defines your steam parental PIN. ASF requires an access to resources protected by steam parental, therefore if you use that feature, you should provide ASF with parental unlock PIN, so it can operate normally. Default value of `null` means that there is no steam parental PIN required to unlock this account, and this is probably what you want if you don't use steam parental functionality. In addition to defining steam parental PIN here, you may also use value of `0` if you want to enter your steam parental PIN on each ASF startup, when needed, instead of putting it in the config. This may be useful for you if you don't want to save sensitive data in config file.

In limited circumstances, ASF is also able to generate a valid Steam parental code itself, although that requires excessive amount of OS resources and additional time to complete, not to mention that it's not guaranteed to succeed, therefore we recommend to not rely on that feature and instead put valid `SteamParentalCode` in the config for ASF to use.

* * *

### `SteamPassword`

`string` type with default value of `null`. This property defines your steam password - the one you use for logging in to steam. In addition to defining steam password here, you may also keep default value of `null` if you want to enter your steam password on each ASF startup instead of putting it in the config. This may be useful for you if you don't want to save sensitive data in config file.

* * *

### `SteamTradeToken`

`string` type with default value of `null`. When you have your bot on your friend list, then bot can send a trade to you right away without worrying about trade token, therefore you can leave this property at default value of `null`. If you however decide to NOT have your bot on your friend list, then you will need to generate and fill a trade token as the user that this bot is expecting to send trades to. In other words, this property should be filled with trade token of the account that is defined with `Master` permission in `SteamUserPermissions` of **this** bot instance.

In order to find your token, as logged in user with `Master` permission, navigate **[here](https://steamcommunity.com/my/tradeoffers/privacy)** and take a look at your trade URL. The token we're looking for is made out of 8 characters after `&token=` part in your trade URL. You should copy and put those 8 characters here, as `SteamTradeToken`. Do not include whole trading URL, neither `&token=` part, only the token itself (8 characters).

* * *

### `SteamUserPermissions`

`ImmutableDictionary<ulong, byte>` type with default value of being empty. This property is a dictionary property which maps given Steam user identified by his 64-bit steam ID, to `byte` number that specifies his permission in ASF instance. Currently available bot permissions in ASF are defined as:

| VALUE | Name          | DESCRIPSHUN                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | None          | No special permission, this is mainly a reference value that is assigned to steam IDs missing in this dictionary - there is no need to define anybody with this permission                         |
| 1     | FamilySharing | Provides minimum access for family sharing users. Once again, this is mainly a reference value since ASF is capable of automatically discovering steam IDs that we permitted for using our library |
| 2     | Operator      | Provides basic access to given bot instances, mainly adding licenses and redeeming keys                                                                                                            |
| 3     | Master        | Provides full access to given bot instance                                                                                                                                                         |

In short, this property allows you to handle permissions for given users. Permissions are important mainly for access to ASF **[commands](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands)**, but also for enabling many ASF features, such as accepting trades. For example you may want to set your own account as `Master`, and give `Operator` access to 2-3 of your friends so they can easily redeem keys for your bot with ASF, while **not** being eligible e.g. for stopping it. Thanks to that you can easily assign permissions to given users and let them use your bot to some specified by you degree.

We recommend to set exactly one user as `Master`, and any amount you wish as `Operators` and below. While it's technically possible to set multiple `Masters` and ASF will work correctly with them, for example by accepting all of their trades sent to the bot, ASF will use only one of them (with lowest steam ID) for every action that requires a single target, for example a `loot` request, so also properties like `SendOnFarmingFinished` or `SendTradePeriod`. If you perfectly understand those limitations, especially the fact that `loot` request will always send items to the `Master` with lowest steam ID, regardless of the `Master` that actually executed the command, then you can define multiple users with `Master` permission here, but we still recommend a single master scheme - multiple masters scheme is discouraged setup that is not supported.

It's nice to note that there is one more extra `Owner` permission, which is declared as `SteamOwnerID` global config property. You can't assign `Owner` permission to anybody here, as `SteamUserPermissions` property defines only permissions that are related to the bot instance, and not ASF as a process. For bot-related tasks, `SteamOwnerID` is treated the same as `Master`, so defining your `SteamOwnerID` here is not necessary.

* * *

### `TradingPreferences`

`byte flags` type with default value of `0`. This property defines ASF behaviour when in trading, and is defined as below:

| VALUE | Name                | DESCRIPSHUN                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | None                | No special trading preferences, default                                                                                                                                                              |
| 1     | AcceptDonations     | Accepts trades in which we're not losing anything                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2     | SteamTradeMatcher   | Passively participates in **[STM](https://www.steamtradematcher.com)**-like trades. Visit **[trading](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Trading#steamtradematcher)** for more info |
| 4     | MatchEverything     | Requires `SteamTradeMatcher` to be set, and in combination with it - also accepts bad trades in addition to good and neutral ones                                                                    |
| 8     | DontAcceptBotTrades | Doesn't automatically accept `loot` trades from other bot instances                                                                                                                                  |
| 16    | MatchActively       | Actively participates in **[STM](https://www.steamtradematcher.com)**-like trades. Visit **[trading](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Trading#matchactively)** for more info      |

PLZ NOTICE DAT DIS PROPERTY IZ `FLAGS` FIELD, THEREFORE IZ POSIBLE 2 CHOOSE ANY COMBINASHUN OV AVAILABLE VALUEZ. CHECK OUT **<A HREF="#json-mappin">FLAGS MAPPIN</A>** IF UD LIEK 2 LERN MOAR. Not enabling any of flags results in `None` option.

For further explanation of ASF trading logic, and description of every available flag, please visit **[trading](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Trading)** section.

* * *

### `TransferableTypes`

`ImmutableHashSet<byte>` type with default value of `1, 3, 5` steam item types. This property defines which Steam item types will be considered for transferring between bots, during `transfer` **[command](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands)**. ASF will ensure that only items from `TransferableTypes` will be included in a trade offer, therefore this property allows you to choose what you want to receive in a trade offer that is being sent to one of your bots.

| VALUE | Name                  | DESCRIPSHUN                                                   |
| ----- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | Unknown               | Every type that doesn't fit in any of the below               |
| 1     | BoosterPack           | Booster pack containing 3 random cards from a game            |
| 2     | Emoticon              | Emoticon to use in Steam Chat                                 |
| 3     | FoilTradingCard       | Foil variant of `TradingCard`                                 |
| 4     | ProfileBackground     | Profile background to use on your Steam profile               |
| 5     | TradingCard           | Steam trading card, being used for crafting badges (non-foil) |
| 6     | SteamGems             | Steam gems being used for crafting boosters, sacks included   |
| 7     | SaleItem              | Special items awarded during Steam sales                      |
| 8     | Consumable            | Special consumable items that disappear after being used      |
| 9     | ProfileModifier       | Special items that can modify Steam profile appearance        |
| 10    | Sticker               | Special items that can be used on Steam chat                  |
| 11    | ChatEffect            | Special items that can be used on Steam chat                  |
| 12    | MiniProfileBackground | Special background for Steam profile                          |
| 13    | AvatarProfileFrame    | Special avatar frame for Steam profile                        |
| 14    | AnimatedAvatar        | Special animated avatar for Steam profile                     |

Please note that regardless of the settings above, ASF will only ask for Steam (`appID` of 753) community (`contextID` of 6) items, so all game items, gifts and likewise, are excluded from the trade offer by definition.

Default ASF setting is based on the most common usage of the bot, with transfering only booster packs, and trading cards (including foils). The property defined here allows you to alter that behaviour in whatever way that satisfies you. Please keep in mind that all types not defined above will show as `Unknown` type, which is especially important when Valve releases some new Steam item, that will be marked as `Unknown` by ASF as well, until it's added here (in the future release). That's why in general it's not recommended to include `Unknown` type in your `TransferableTypes`, unless you know what you're doing, and you also understand that ASF will send your entire inventory in a trade offer if Steam Network gets broken again and reports all your items as `Unknown`. My strong suggestion is to not include `Unknown` type in the `TransferableTypes`, even if you expect to transfer everything.

* * *

### `UseLoginKeys`

`BOOL` TYPE WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `TRUE`. This property defines if ASF should use login keys mechanism for this Steam account. Login keys mechanism works very similar to official Steam client's "remember me" option, which makes it possible for ASF to store and use temporary one-time use login key for next logon attempt, effectively skipping a need of providing password, Steam Guard or 2FA code as long as our login key is valid. Login key is stored in `BotName.db` file and updated automatically. This is why you don't need to provide password/SteamGuard/2FA code after logging in successfully with ASF just once.

Login keys are used by default for your convenience, so you don't need to input `SteamPassword`, SteamGuard or 2FA code (when not using **[ASF 2FA](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Two-factor-authentication)**) on each login. It's also superior alternative since login key can be used only for a single time and does not reveal your original password in any way. Exactly the same method is being used by your original Steam client, which saves your account name and login key for your next logon attempt, effectively being the same as using `SteamLogin` with `UseLoginKeys` and empty `SteamPassword` in ASF.

However, some people could be concerned even about this little detail, therefore this option is available here for you if you'd like to ensure that ASF won't store any kind of token that would allow resuming previous session after being closed, which will result in full authentication being mandatory on each login attempt. Disabling this option will work exactly the same as not checking "remember me" in official Steam client. Unless you know what you're doing, you should keep it with default value of `true`.

* * *

### `UserInterfaceMode`

`BYTE` TYPE WIF DEFAULT VALUE OV `0`. This property specifies user interface mode that the bot will be announced with after logging in to Steam network. Currently you can choose one of below modes:

| VALUE | Name       |
| ----- | ---------- |
| `0`   | Default    |
| `1`   | BigPicture |
| `2`   | Mobile     |

If you're not sure how to set this property, leave it with default value of `0`.

* * *

## File structure

ASF is using quite simple file structure.

```text
├── config
│     ├── ASF.json
│     ├── ASF.db
│     ├── Bot1.json
│     ├── Bot1.db
│     ├── Bot1.bin
│     ├── Bot2.json
│     ├── Bot2.db
│     ├── Bot2.bin
│     └── ...
├── ArchiSteamFarm.dll
├── log.txt
└── ...
```

In order to move ASF to new location, for example another PC, it's enough to move/copy `config` directory alone, and that's the recommended way of doing any form of "ASF backups", since you can always download the remaining (program) part from the GitHub, while not risking corrupting internal ASF files, e.g. through a faulty backup.

`log.txt` file holds the log generated by your last ASF run. This file doesn't contain any sensitive information, and is extremely useful when it comes to issues, crashes or simply as an information to you what happened in last ASF run. We will very often ask about this file if you run into issues or bugs. ASF automatically manages this file for you, but you can further tweak ASF **[logging](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Logging)** module if you're advanced user.

`config` directory is the place that holds configuration for ASF, including all of its bots.

`ASF.json` is a global ASF configuration file. This config is used for specifying how ASF behaves as a process, which affects all of the bots and program itself. You can find global properties there, such as ASF process owner, auto-updates or debugging.

`BotName.json` is a config of given bot instance. This config is used for specifying how given bot instance behaves, therefore those settings are specific to that bot only and not shared across other ones. This allows you to configure bots with various different settings and not necessarily all of them working in exactly the same way. Every bot is named using unique identifier, chosen by you in place of `BotName`.

Apart from config files, ASF also uses `config` directory for storing databases.

`ASF.db` is a global ASF database file. It acts as a global persistent storage and is used for saving various information related to ASF process, such as IPs of local Steam servers. **You should not edit this file**.

`BotName.db` is a database of given bot instance. This file is used for storing crucial data about given bot instance in persistent storage, such as login keys or ASF 2FA. **You should not edit this file**.

`BotName.bin` is a special file of given bot instance, which holds information about Steam sentry hash. Sentry hash is used for authenticating using `SteamGuard` mechanism, very similar to Steam `ssfn` file. **You should not edit this file**.

`BotName.keys` is a special file that can be used for importing keys into **[background games redeemer](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Background-games-redeemer)**. It's not mandatory and not generated, but recognized by ASF. This file is automatically deleted after keys are successfully imported.

`BotName.maFile` is a special file that can be used for importing **[ASF 2FA](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Two-factor-authentication)**. It's not mandatory and not generated, but recognized by ASF if your `BotName` does not use ASF 2FA yet. This file is automatically deleted after ASF 2FA is successfully imported.

* * *

## JSON mapping

Every configuration property has its type. Type of the property defines values that are valid for it. You can only use values that are valid for given type - if you use invalid value, then ASF won't be able to parse your config.

**We strongly recommend to use ConfigGenerator for generating configs** - it handles most of the low-level stuff (such as types validation) for you, so you only need to input proper values, and you also don't need to understand variable types specified below. This section is mainly for people generating/editing configs manually, so they know what values they can use.

Types used by ASF are native C# types, which are specified below:

* * *

`bool` - Boolean type accepting only `true` and `false` values.

Example: `"Enabled": true`

* * *

`byte` - Unsigned byte type, accepting only integers from `0` to `255` (inclusive).

Example: `"ConnectionTimeout": 60`

* * *

`ushort` - Unsigned short type, accepting only integers from `0` to `65535` (inclusive).

Example: `"WebLimiterDelay": 300`

* * *

`uint` - Unsigned integer type, accepting only integers from `0` to `4294967295` (inclusive).

* * *

`ulong` - Unsigned long integer type, accepting only integers from `0` to `18446744073709551615` (inclusive).

Example: `"SteamMasterClanID": 103582791440160998`

* * *

`string` - String type, accepting any sequence of characters, including empty sequence `""` and `null`. Empty sequence and `null` value are treated the same by ASF, so it's up to your preference which one you want to use (we stick with `null`).

Examples: `"SteamLogin": null`, `"SteamLogin": ""`, `"SteamLogin": "MyAccountName"`

* * *

`ImmutableList<valueType>` - Immutable collection (list) of values in given `valueType`. In JSON, it's defined as array of elements in given `valueType`. ASF uses `List` to indicate that given property supports multiple values and that their order might be relevant.

Example for `ImmutableList<byte>`: `"FarmingOrders": [15, 11, 7]`

* * *

`ImmutableHashSet<valueType>` - Immutable collection (set) of unique values in given `valueType`. In JSON, it's defined as array of elements in given `valueType`. ASF uses `HashSet` to indicate that given property makes sense only for unique values and that their order doesn't matter, therefore it'll intentionally ignore any potential duplicates during parsing (if you happened to supply them anyway).

Example for `ImmutableHashSet<uint>`: `"Blacklist": [267420, 303700, 335590]`

* * *

`ImmutableDictionary<keyType, valueType>` - Immutable dictionary (map) that maps a unique key specified in its `keyType`, to value specified in its `valueType`. In JSON, it's defined as an object with key-value pairs. Keep in mind that `keyType` is always quoted in this case, even if it's value type such as `ulong`. There is also a strict requirement of the key being unique across the map, this time enforced by JSON as well.

Example for `ImmutableDictionary<ulong, byte>`: `"SteamUserPermissions": { "76561198174813138": 3, "76561198174813137": 1 }`

* * *

`flags` - Flags attribute combines several different properties into one final value by applying bitwise operations. This allows you to choose any possible combination of various different allowed values at the same time. The final value is constructed as a sum of values of all enabled options.

For example, given following values:

| VALUE | Name |
| ----- | ---- |
| 0     | None |
| 1     | A    |
| 2     | B    |
| 4     | C    |

Using `B + C` would result in value of `6`, using `A + C` would result in value of `5`, using `C` would result in value of `4` and so on. This allows you to create any possible combination of enabled values - if you decided to enable all of them, making `None + A + B + C`, you'd get value of `7`. Also notice that flag with value of `0` is enabled by definition in all other available combinations, therefore very often it's a flag that doesn't enable anything specifically (such as `None`).

So as you can see, in above example we have 3 available flags to switch on/off (`A`, `B`, `C`), and `8` possible values overall:

- `None -> 0`
- `A -> 1`
- `B -> 2`
- `A+B -> 3`
- `C -> 4`
- `A+C -> 5`
- `B+C -> 6`
- `A+B+C -> 7`

Example: `"SteamProtocols": 7`

## Compatibility mapping

Due to JavaScript limitations of being unable to properly serialize simple `ulong` fields in JSON when using web-based ConfigGenerator, `ulong` fields will be rendered as strings with `s_` prefix in the resulting config. This includes for example `"SteamOwnerID": 76561198006963719` that will be written by our ConfigGenerator as `"s_SteamOwnerID": "76561198006963719"`. ASF includes proper logic for handling this string mapping automatically, so `s_` entries in your configs are actually valid and correctly generated. If you're generating configs yourself, we recommend to stick with original `ulong` fields if possible, but if you're unable to do so, you can also follow this scheme and encode them as strings with `s_` prefix added to their names. We hope to resolve this JavaScript limitation eventually.

## Configs compatibility

It's top priority for ASF to remain compatible with older configs. As you should already know, missing config properties are treated the same as they would be defined with their **default values**. Therefore, if new config property gets introduced in new version of ASF, all your configs will remain **compatible** with new version, and ASF will treat that new config property as it'd be defined with its **default value**. You can always add, remove or edit config properties according to your needs. We recommend to limit defined config properties only to those that you want to change, since this way you automatically inherit default values for all other ones, not only keeping your config clean but also increasing compatibility in case we decide to change a default value for property that you don't want to explicitly set yourself (e.g. `WebLimiterDelay`).

## Auto-reload

Starting with ASF V2.1.6.2+, the program is now aware of configs being modified "on-the-fly" - thanks to that, ASF will automatically:

- Create (and start, if needed) new bot instance, when you create its config
- Stop (if needed) and remove old bot instance, when you delete its config
- Stop (and start, if needed) any bot instance, when you edit its config
- Restart (if needed) the bot under new name, when you rename its config

All of the above is transparent and will be done automatically without a need of restarting the program, or killing other (unaffected) bot instances.

In addition to that, ASF will also restart itself (if `AutoRestart` permits) if you modify core ASF `ASF.json` config. Likewise, program will quit if you delete or rename it.
