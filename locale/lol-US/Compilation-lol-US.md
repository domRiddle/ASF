# COMPILASHUN

COMPILASHUN IZ TEH PROCES OV CREATIN EXECUTABLE FILE. DIS AR TEH WUT U WANTS 2 DO IF U WANTS 2 ADD UR OWN CHANGEZ 2 ASF, OR IF U 4 WHATEVR REASON DOAN TRUST EXECUTABLE FILEZ PROVIDD IN OFFISHUL **[RELEASEZ](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/releases)**. IF URE USR AN NOT DEVELOPR, MOST LIKELY U WANTS 2 USE ALREADY PRECOMPILD BINARIEZ, BUT IF UD LIEK 2 USE UR OWN ONEZ, OR LERN SOMETHIN NEW, CONTINUE READIN.

ASF CAN BE COMPILD ON ANY CURRENTLY SUPPORTD PLATFORM, AS LONG AS U HAS ALL NEEDD TOOLS 2 DO SO.

---

## .NET SDK

REGARDLES OV PLATFORM, U NED FULL .NET SDK (NOT JUS RUNTIME) IN ORDR 2 COMPILE ASF. INSTALLASHUN INSTRUCSHUNS CAN BE FINDZ ON **[.NET DOWNLOAD PAEG](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)**. U NED 2 INSTALL APPROPRIATE .NET SDK VERSHUN 4 UR OS. AFTR SUCCESFUL INSTALLASHUN, `dotnet` COMMAND SHUD BE WERKIN AN OPERATIV. U CAN VERIFY IF IT WERKZ WIF `dotnet --info`. ALSO ENSURE DAT UR .NET SDK MATCHEZ ASF **[RUNTIME REQUIREMENTS](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Compatibility-lol-us#runtime-requirements)**.

---

## COMPILASHUN

ASSUMIN U HAS .NET SDK OPERATIV AN IN APPROPRIATE VERSHUN, SIMPLY NAVIGATE 2 SOURCE ASF DIRECTORY (CLOND OR DOWNLOADD AN UNPACKD ASF REPO) AN EXECUTE:

```shell
dotnet publish ArchiSteamFarm -c "Release" -f "net6.0" -o "out/generic"
```

IF URE USIN LINUX/OS X, U CAN INSTEAD USE `cc.sh` SCRIPT WHICH WILL DO TEH SAME, IN BIT MOAR COMPLEX MANNR.

IF COMPILASHUN ENDD SUCCESFULLY, U CAN FIND UR ASF IN `source` FLAVR IN `out/generic` DIRECTORY. DIS AR TEH TEH SAME AS OFFISHUL `generic` ASF BUILD, BUT IT HAS FORCD `UpdateChannel` AN `UpdatePeriod` OV `0`, WHICH IZ APPROPRIATE 4 SELF-BUILDZ.

### OS-SPECIFIC

U CAN ALSO GENERATE OS-SPECIFIC .NET PACKAGE IF U HAS SPECIFIC NED. IN GENERAL U SHOULDNT DO DAT CUZ UVE JUS COMPILD `generic` FLAVR DAT U CAN RUN WIF UR ALREADY-INSTALLD .NET RUNTIME DAT UVE USD 4 DA COMPILASHUN IN DA FURST PLACE, BUT JUS IN CASE U WANTS 2:

```shell
dotnet publish ArchiSteamFarm -c "Release" -f "net6.0" -o "out/linux-x64" -r "linux-x64"
```

OV COURSE, REPLACE `linux-x64` WIF OS-ARCHITECCHUR DAT U WANTS 2 TARGET, SUCH AS `win-x64`. DIS BUILD WILL ALSO HAS UPDATEZ DISABLD.

### .NET FRAMEWORK

In a very rare case when you'd want to build `generic-netf` package, you can change target framework from `net6.0` to `net48`. KEEP IN MIND DAT ULL NED APPROPRIATE **[.NET FRAMEWORK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/visual-studio-sdks)** DEVELOPR PACK 4 COMPILIN `netf` VARIANT, IN ADDISHUN 2 .NET SDK, SO TEH BELOW WILL WERK ONLY ON WINDOWS:

```shell
dotnet publish ArchiSteamFarm -c "Release" -f "net48" -o "out/generic-netf"
```

IN CASE OV BEAN UNABLE 2 INSTALL .NET FRAMEWORK OR EVEN .NET SDK ITSELF (E.G. CUZ OV BUILDIN ON `linux-x86` WIF `mono`), U CAN CALL `msbuild` DIRECTLY. ULL ALSO NED 2 SPECIFY `ASFNetFramework` MANUALLY, AS ASF BY DEFAULT DISABLEZ `netf` BUILD ON NON-WINDOWS PLATFORMS:

```shell
msbuild /m /r /t:Publish /p:Configuration=Release /p:TargetFramework=net48 /p:PublishDir=out/generic-netf /p:ASFNetFramework=true ArchiSteamFarm
```

### ASF-UI

While the above steps are everything that is required to have a fully working build of ASF, you may *also* be interested in building **[ASF-ui](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/IPC#asf-ui)**, our graphical web interface. From ASF side, all you need to do is dropping ASF-ui build output in standard `ASF-ui/dist` location, then building ASF with it (again, if needed).

ASF-ui is part of ASF's source tree as a **[git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)**, ensure that you've cloned the repo with `git clone --recursive`, as otherwise you'll not have the required files. You'll also need a working NPM, **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)** comes with it. If you're using Linux/OS X, we recommend our `cc.sh` script, which will automatically cover building and shipping ASF-ui (if possible, that is, if you're meeting the requirements we've just mentioned).

In addition to the `cc.sh` script, we also attach the simplified build instructions below, refer to **[ASF-ui repo](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ASF-ui)** for additional documentation. From ASF's source tree location, so as above, execute the following commands:

```shell
rm -rf "ASF-ui/dist" # ASF-ui doesn't clean itself after old build

npm ci --prefix ASF-ui
npm run-script deploy --prefix ASF-ui

rm -rf "out/generic/www" # Ensure that our build output is clean of the old files
dotnet publish ArchiSteamFarm -c "Release" -f "net6.0" -o "out/generic" # Or accordingly to what you need as per the above
```

You should now be able to find the ASF-ui files in your `out/generic/www` folder. ASF will be able to serve those files to your browser.

Alternatively, you can simply build ASF-ui, whether manually or with the help of our repo, then copy the build output over to `${OUT}/www` folder manually, where `${OUT}` is the output folder of ASF that you've specified with `-o` parameter. This is exactly what ASF is doing as part of the build process, it copies `ASF-ui/dist` (if exists) over to `${OUT}/www`, nothing fancy.

## DEVELOPMENT

IF UD LIEK 2 EDIT ASF CODE, U CAN USE ANY .NET COMPATIBLE IDE 4 DAT PURPOSE, ALTHOUGH EVEN DAT IZ OPSHUNAL, SINCE U CAN AS WELL EDIT WIF NOTEPAD AN COMPILE WIF `dotnet` COMMAND DESCRIBD ABOOV. STILL, 4 WINDOWS WE RECOMMEND **[LATEST VISUAL STUDIO](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads)** (FREE COMMUNITY VERSHUN IZ MOAR THAN ENOUGH).

IF UD LIEK 2 WERK WIF ASF CODE ON LINUX/OS X INSTEAD, WE RECOMMEND **[LATEST VISUAL STUDIO CODE](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)**. IZ NOT AS RICH AS CLASIC VISUAL STUDIO, BUT IZ GUD ENOUGH.

OV COURSE ALL SUGGESHUNS ABOOV R ONLY RECOMMENDASHUNS, U CAN USE WHATEVR U WANTS 2, IT COMEZ DOWN 2 `dotnet build` COMMAND ANYWAY. WE USE **[JETBRAINS RIDR](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider)** 4 ASF DEVELOPMENT, ALTHOUGH IZ NOT FREE SOLUSHUN.

## TAGS

`main` BRANCH IZ NOT GUARANTED 2 BE IN STATE DAT ALLOWS SUCCESFUL COMPILASHUN OR FLAWLES ASF EXECUSHUN IN DA FURST PLACE, SINCE IZ DEVELOPMENT BRANCH JUS LIEK STATD IN R **[RELEASE CYCLE](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Release-cycle-lol-US)**. IF U WANTS 2 COMPILE OR REFERENCE ASF FRUM SOURCE, DEN U SHUD USE APPROPRIATE **[TAG](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/tags)** 4 DAT PURPOSE, WHICH GUARANTEEZ AT LEAST SUCCESFUL COMPILASHUN, AN VRY LIKELY ALSO FLAWLES EXECUSHUN (IF BUILD WUZ MARKD AS STABLE RELEASE). IN ORDR 2 CHECK TEH CURRENT "HEALTH" OV TEH TREE, U CAN USE R CI - **<A HREF="https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/actions/workflows/ci.yml?query=branch%3Amain">GITHUB</a>**.

## OFFISHUL RELEASEZ

OFFISHUL ASF RELEASEZ R COMPILD BY **[GITHUB](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/actions)** ON WINDOWS, WIF LATEST .NET SDK DAT MATCHEZ ASF **[RUNTIME REQUIREMENTS](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Compatibility-lol-US#runtime-requirements)**. AFTR PASIN TESTS, ALL PACKAGEZ R DEPLOYD AS TEH RELEASE, ALSO ON GITHUB. DIS ALSO GUARANTEEZ TRANZPARENCY, SINCE GITHUB ALWAYS USEZ OFFISHUL PUBLIC SOURCE 4 ALL BUILDZ, AN U CAN COMPARE CHECKSUMS OV GITHUB ARTIFACTS WIF GITHUB RELEASE ASSETS. ASF DEVELOPERS DO NOT COMPILE OR PUBLISH BUILDZ THEMSELVEZ, EXCEPT 4 PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT PROCES AN DEBUGGIN.

Starting from ASF V5.2.0.5, in addition to the above, ASF maintainers manually validate and publish build checksums on independent from GitHub, remote server, as additional security measure. This step is mandatory for existing ASFs to consider the release as a valid candidate for auto-update functionality.
