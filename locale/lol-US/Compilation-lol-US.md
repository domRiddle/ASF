# COMPILASHUN

COMPILASHUN IZ TEH PROCES OV CREATIN EXECUTABLE FILE. DIS AR TEH WUT U WANTS 2 DO IF U WANTS 2 ADD UR OWN CHANGEZ 2 ASF, OR IF U 4 WHATEVR REASON DOAN TRUST EXECUTABLE FILEZ PROVIDD IN OFFISHUL **[RELEASEZ](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/releases)**. IF URE USR AN NOT DEVELOPR, MOST LIKELY U WANTS 2 USE ALREADY PRECOMPILD BINARIEZ, BUT IF UD LIEK 2 USE UR OWN ONEZ, OR LERN SOMETHIN NEW, CONTINUE READIN.

ASF CAN BE COMPILD ON ANY CURRENTLY SUPPORTD PLATFORM, AS LONG AS U HAS ALL NEEDD TOOLS 2 DO SO.

---

## .NET SDK

Regardless of platform, you need full .NET SDK (not just runtime) in order to compile ASF. Installation instructions can be found on **[.NET download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)**. You need to install appropriate .NET SDK version for your OS. AFTR SUCCESFUL INSTALLASHUN, `dotnet` COMMAND SHUD BE WERKIN AN OPERATIV. U CAN VERIFY IF IT WERKZ WIF `dotnet --info`. Also ensure that your .NET SDK matches ASF **[runtime requirements](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Compatibility#runtime-requirements)**.

---

## COMPILASHUN

Assuming you have .NET SDK operative and in appropriate version, simply navigate to source ASF directory (cloned or downloaded and unpacked ASF repo) and execute:

```shell
dotnet publish ArchiSteamFarm -c "Release" -f "net5.0" -o "out/generic"
```

IF URE USIN LINUX/OS X, U CAN INSTEAD USE `cc.sh` SCRIPT WHICH WILL DO TEH SAME, IN BIT MOAR COMPLEX MANNR.

IF COMPILASHUN ENDD SUCCESFULLY, U CAN FIND UR ASF IN `source` FLAVR IN `out/generic` DIRECTORY. DIS AR TEH TEH SAME AS OFFISHUL `generic` ASF BUILD, BUT IT HAS FORCD `UpdateChannel` AN `UpdatePeriod` OV `0`, WHICH IZ APPROPRIATE 4 SELF-BUILDZ.

### OS-SPECIFIC

You can also generate OS-specific .NET package if you have a specific need. In general you shouldn't do that because you've just compiled `generic` flavour that you can run with your already-installed .NET runtime that you've used for the compilation in the first place, but just in case you want to:

```shell
dotnet publish ArchiSteamFarm -c "Release" -f "net5.0" -o "out/linux-x64" -r "linux-x64"
```

OV COURSE, REPLACE `linux-x64` WIF OS-ARCHITECCHUR DAT U WANTS 2 TARGET, SUCH AS `win-x64`. DIS BUILD WILL ALSO HAS UPDATEZ DISABLD.

### .NET FRAMEWORK

IN VRY RARE CASE WHEN UD WANTS 2 BUILD `generic-netf` PACKAGE, U CAN CHANGE TARGET FRAMEWORK FRUM `net5.0` 2 `net48`. Keep in mind that you'll need appropriate **[.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/visual-studio-sdks)** developer pack for compiling `netf` variant, in addition to .NET SDK, so the below will work only on Windows:

```shell
dotnet publish ArchiSteamFarm -c "Release" -f "net48" -o "out/generic-netf"
```

In case of being unable to install .NET Framework or even .NET SDK itself (e.g. because of building on `linux-x86` with `mono`), you can call `msbuild` directly. ULL ALSO NED 2 SPECIFY `ASFNetFramework` MANUALLY, AS ASF BY DEFAULT DISABLEZ `netf` BUILD ON NON-WINDOWS PLATFORMS:

```shell
msbuild /m /r /t:Publish /p:Configuration=Release /p:TargetFramework=net48 /p:PublishDir=out/generic-netf /p:ASFNetFramework=true ArchiSteamFarm
```

## DEVELOPMENT

If you'd like to edit ASF code, you can use any .NET compatible IDE for that purpose, although even that is optional, since you can as well edit with a notepad and compile with `dotnet` command described above. STILL, 4 WINDOWS WE RECOMMEND **[LATEST VISUAL STUDIO](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads)** (FREE COMMUNITY VERSHUN IZ MOAR THAN ENOUGH).

IF UD LIEK 2 WERK WIF ASF CODE ON LINUX/OS X INSTEAD, WE RECOMMEND **[LATEST VISUAL STUDIO CODE](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)**. IZ NOT AS RICH AS CLASIC VISUAL STUDIO, BUT IZ GUD ENOUGH.

OV COURSE ALL SUGGESHUNS ABOOV R ONLY RECOMMENDASHUNS, U CAN USE WHATEVR U WANTS 2, IT COMEZ DOWN 2 `dotnet build` COMMAND ANYWAY. WE USE **[JETBRAINS RIDR](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider)** 4 ASF DEVELOPMENT, ALTHOUGH IZ NOT FREE SOLUSHUN.

`main` BRANCH IZ NOT GUARANTED 2 BE IN STATE DAT ALLOWS SUCCESFUL COMPILASHUN OR FLAWLES ASF EXECUSHUN IN DA FURST PLACE, SINCE IZ DEVELOPMENT BRANCH JUS LIEK STATD IN R **[RELEASE CYCLE](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Release-cycle-lol-US)**. IF U WANTS 2 COMPILE OR REFERENCE ASF FRUM SOURCE, DEN U SHUD USE APPROPRIATE **[TAG](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/tags)** 4 DAT PURPOSE, WHICH GUARANTEEZ AT LEAST SUCCESFUL COMPILASHUN, AN VRY LIKELY ALSO FLAWLES EXECUSHUN (IF BUILD WUZ MARKD AS STABLE RELEASE).

## OFFISHUL RELEASEZ

Official ASF releases are compiled by **[GitHub](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/actions)** on Windows, with latest .NET SDK that matches ASF **[runtime requirements](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Compatibility#runtime-requirements)**. AFTR PASIN TESTS, ALL PACKAGEZ R DEPLOYD AS TEH RELEASE, ALSO ON GITHUB. DIS ALSO GUARANTEEZ TRANZPARENCY, SINCE GITHUB ALWAYS USEZ OFFISHUL PUBLIC SOURCE 4 ALL BUILDZ, AN U CAN COMPARE CHECKSUMS OV GITHUB ARTIFACTS WIF GITHUB RELEASE ASSETS. ASF DEVELOPERS DO NOT COMPILE OR PUBLISH BUILDZ THEMSELVEZ, EXCEPT 4 PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT PROCES AN DEBUGGIN.
