ASF will also do its best to ensure that the trade offers are going through. On the next run, which normally happens in 6 hours, ASF will cancel any pending trade offers that still weren't accepted, and deprioritize steamIDs taking part in them to hopefully prefer more active bots first. Still, if deprioritized bots are the last ones that have the match we need, we'll still attempt to match them (again).

### Y DO NEEDZ `LicenseID` 2 USE `MatchActively`? WUZ NOT IT FREE BEFORE?

ASF IZ, AN REMAINS, FREE AN OPEN-SOURCE, AS IT WUZ ESTABLISHD AT TEH START OV TEH PROJECT BAK IN OCTOBR 2015. SOURCE CODE OV `ItemsMatcher` PLUGIN AN THEREFORE `MatchActively` FEACHUR IZ AVAILABLE IN R REPOSITORY, WHILE ASF PROGRAM IZ ENTIRELY NON-COMMERSHUL, WE DO NOT EARN ANYTHIN FRUM CONTRIBUSHUNS 2 IT, BUILDIN OR PUBLISHIN. OVAR DOSE PAST 7+ YEERS ASF HAS RECEIVD TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OV DEVELOPMENT, AN IZ STILL BEAN IMPROOVD AN ENHANCD WIF EVRY MONTHLY STABLE RELEASE MOSTLY BY SINGLE PERSON, **[JustArchi](https://github.com/JustArchi)** - WIF NO STRINGS ATTACHD. TEH ONLY FUNDIN WE RECEIV IZ FRUM NON-OBLIGATORY DONASHUNS DAT COME FRUM R USERS.

4 VRY LONG TIEM, TIL OCTOBR 2022, `MatchActively` FEACHUR WUZ PART OV ASF CORE AN AVAILABLE 4 EVRYONE 2 USE. IN OCTOBR 2022, VALVE, TEH COMPANY BEHIND STEAM, HAS PUT VRY SEVERE RATE LIMITS ON FETCHIN INVENTORIEZ OV OTHR BOTS - WHICH RENDERD PREVIOUS FUNCSHUNALITY ENTIRELY BROKD, WIF NO POSIBILITY OV SOLUSHUN 2 RESOLVE DIS PROBLEM. THEREFORE, DUE 2 TEH FACT DAT TEH FEACHUR HAS BECAME ENTIRELY DEFUNCT WIF NO CHANCE OV BEAN FIXD, IT HAD 2 BE REMOVD FRUM ASF CORE IN VERSHUN 5.4.1.0 AS OBSOLETE.

`MatchActively` WUZ RESURRECTD AS PART OV OFFISHUL `ItemsMatcher` PLUGIN DAT FURTHR ENHANCEZ ASF WIF ACTIV CARDZ MATCHIN FUNCSHUNALITY. Resurrecting `MatchActively` feature required from us **extraordinary amount of work** to create ASF backend, entirely new service hosted on a server, with more than a hundred of proxies attached for resolving inventories, all exclusively to allow ASF clients to make use of `MatchActively` like before. Due to the amount of work involved, as well as resources that are not free and require to be paid on monthly basis by us (domain, server, proxies), we've decided to offer this functionality to our sponsors, that is, people that already support ASF project on monthly basis, thanks to whom we can make those paid resources available.

R GOAL ISNT 2 PROFIT FRUM IT, BUT RATHR, COVR TEH **monthly costs** DAT R EXCLUSIVELY LINKD WIF OFFERIN DIS OPSHUN - THAZ Y WE OFFR IT BASICALLY 4 NOTHIN, BUT WE DO HAS 2 CHARGE LIL 4 IT AS WE CANT PAI HUNDREDZ OV DOLLARS FRUM R OWN POCKETS EACH MONTH, JUS 2 MAK IT AVAILABLE 4 U. We're not really in a position to discuss the price either, it's Valve that forced those costs upon us, and the alternative is to not have such feature available at all, which of course applies if you decide, for whatever reason, that you can't justify using our plugin on those terms.

In any case, we understand that `MatchActively` is not for everybody, and we hope that you also understand why we can't offer it for free.

### HOW I CAN GIT AN ACCES?

`ItemsMatcher` is offered as part of monthly $5+ sponsor tier on **[JustArchi's GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/JustArchi)**. It's also possible to become one-time sponsor, although in this case the license will be valid only for a month (with possibility of extension in the same way). Once you become a sponsor of $5 tier (or higher), read **[configuration](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration#licenseid)** section to obtain and fill `LicenseID`. Afterwards, you only need to enable `MatchActively` in `TradingPreferences` of your chosen bot.

TEH LICENSE ALLOWS U 2 SEND LIMITD AMOUNT OV REQUESTS 2 TEH SERVR. $5 tier allows you to use `MatchActively` for one bot account (4 requests daily), and every additional $5 adds two more bot accounts (8 requests daily). For example, if you want to run it on three accounts, that'll be covered by $10 tier and higher.
