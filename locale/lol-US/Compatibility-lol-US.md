# COMPATIBILITY

ASF IZ C# APPLICASHUN DAT IZ RUNNIN ON .NET CORE PLATFORM. DIS MEANZ DAT ASF IZ NOT COMPILD DIRECTLY INTO **[MACHINE CODE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code)** DAT IZ RUNNIN ON UR CPU, BUT INTO **[CIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Intermediate_Language)** DAT REQUIREZ CIL-COMPATIBLE RUNTIME 4 EXECUTIN IT.

DIS APPROACH HAS GIGANTIC AMOUNT OV ADVANTAGEZ, AS CIL IZ PLATFORM-INDEPENDENT, WHICH IZ Y ASF CAN RUN NATIVELY ON LOTZ DA AVAILABLE OSEZ, ESPECIALLY WINDOWS, LINUX AN OS X. THAR IZ NOT ONLY NO EMULASHUN NEEDD, BUT ALSO SUPPORT 4 ALL PLATFORM-RELATD AN HARDWARE-RELATD OPTIMIZASHUNS, SUCH AS CPU SSE INSTRUCSHUNS. THX 2 DAT, ASF CAN ACHIEVE SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE AN OPTIMIZASHUN, WHILE STILL OFFERIN PERFIK COMPATIBILITY AN RELIABILITY.

DIS ALSO MEANZ DAT ASF HAS **NO SPECIFIC OS REQUIREMENT**, CUZ IT REQUIREZ WERKIN **RUNTIME** ON DAT OS AN NOT OS ITSELF. AS LONG AS DAT RUNTIME IZ EXECUTIN ASF CODE PROPERLY, IT DOEZ NOT MATTR WHETHR UNDERLYIN OS IZ WINDOWS, LINUX, OS X, BSD, SONY PLAYSTASHUN 4, NINTENDO WII OR UR TOASTR - AS LONG AS THAR IZ **[.NET CORE 4 IT](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup#daily-builds)**, THAR IZ **[ASF](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/releases/latest)** 4 IT.

HOWEVR, REGARDLES OV WER U RUN ASF, U MUST ENSURE DAT UR TARGET PLATFORM HAS **[.NET CORE PREREQUIZIETS](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/Documentation/prereqs.md)** INSTALLD. DOSE R LOW-LEVEL LIBRARIEZ REQUIRD 4 PROPR RUNTIME FUNCSHUNALITY AN ABSOLUTELY CORE 4 ASF 2 WERK IN DA FURST PLACE. VRY LIKELY U CAN HAS SUM OV THEM (OR EVEN ALL) ALREADY INSTALLD.

## ASF PACKAGIN

ASF COMEZ IN 2 MAIN FLAVOURS - GENERIC PACKAGE AN OS-SPECIFIC. FUNCSHUNALITY-WIZE BOTH PACKAGEZ R EGSAKTLY TEH SAME, THEYRE BOTH ALSO CAPABLE OV AUTOMATICALLY UPDATIN THEMSELVEZ. TEH ONLY DIFFERENCE TWEEN THEM IZ WHETHR OR NOT ASF **GENERIC** PACKAGE ALSO COMEZ WIF **OS-SPECIFIC** RUNTIME 2 POWR IT.

---

### GENERIC

GENERIC PACKAGE IZ PLATFORM-AGNOSTIC BUILD DAT DOESNT INCLUDE ANY MACHINE-SPECIFIC CODE. DIS SETUP REQUIREZ FRUM U 2 HAS .NET CORE RUNTIME ALREADY INSTALLD ON UR OS **IN APPROPRIATE VERSHUN**. WE ALL KNOE HOW TROUBLESOME IT 2 KEEP DEPENDENCIEZ UP-2-DATE, THEREFORE DIS PACKAGE IZ HER MAINLY 4 PEEPS DAT **ALREADY USE** .NET CORE AN DOAN WANTS 2 DUPLICATE THEIR RUNTIME SOLELY 4 ASF IF THEY CAN MAK USE OV WUT THEY HAS INSTALLD ALREADY. GENERIC PACKAGE ALSO ALLOWS U 2 RUN ASF **ANYWHERE WER U CAN OBTAIN WERKIN IMPLEMENTASHUN OV .NET CORE RUNTIME**, REGARDLES IF THAR EXISTS OS-SPECIFIC ASF BUILD 4 IT, OR NOT.

IZ NOT RECOMMENDD 2 USE GENERIC FLAVR IF URE CASUAL OR EVEN ADVANCD USR DAT JUS WANTS 2 MAK ASF WERK AN NOT DIG INTO .NET CORE TECHNICAL DETAILS. IN OTHR WERDZ - IF U KNOE WUT DIS AR TEH, U CAN USE IT, OTHERWIZE IZ MUTCH BETTR 2 USE OS-SPECIFIC PACKAGE EXPLAIND BELOW.

#### .NET FRAMEWORK PACKAGE

IN ADDISHUN 2 GENERIC PACKAGE MENSHUND ABOOV, THAR IZ ALSO `generic-netf` PACKAGE WHICH IZ BUILT ON TOP OV .NET FRAMEWORK (AN NOT .NET CORE). DIS PACKAGE IZ LEGACY VARIANT DAT PROVIDEZ MISIN COMPATIBILITY KNOWN FRUM ASF V2 TIEMS, AN CAN BE RUN E.G. WIF **[MONO](https://www.mono-project.com)**, WHILE .NET CORE `generic` PACKAGE CANT AS OV TODAI.

IN GENERAL U SHUD **AVOID DIS PACKAGE AS MUTCH AS POSIBLE**, AS MAJORITY OV OPERATIN SISTEMS AN SETUPS R PERFECTLY (AN MUTCH BETTR) SUPPORTD WIF `generic` PACKAGE MENSHUND ABOOV. IN FACT, DIS PACKAGE MAKEZ SENSE 2 BE USD ONLY ON PLATFORMS DAT LACK WERKIN .NET CORE RUNTIME, WHILE HAVIN WERKIN MONO IMPLEMENTASHUN. EXAMPLEZ OV SUCH PLATFORMS INCLUDE `linux-x86` (32-BIT I386/I686 LINUX), AS WELL AS `linux-armel` (ARMV6 BOARDZ FINDZ E.G. IN RASPBERRY PI 0 & 1), ALL OV WHICH DO NOT HAS OFFISHUL WERKIN .NET CORE RUNTIME AS OV TODAI.

AS TEH TIEM GOEZ ON WIF MOAR PLATFORMS BEAN SUPPORTD BY .NET CORE AN LES COMPATIBILITY TWEEN .NET FRAMEWORK AN .NET CORE, `generic-netf` PACKAGE WILL BE ENTIRELY REPLACD WIF `generic` WAN IN DA FUCHUR. PLZ REFRAIN FRUM USIN IT IF U CAN USE ANY .NET CORE PACKAGE INSTEAD, AS `generic-netf` IZ MISIN LOT OV FUNCSHUNALITY AN COMPATIBILITY COMPARD 2 .NET CORE VERSHUNS, AN ITLL BE ONLY LES FUNCSHUNAL AS TEH TIEM GOEZ ON. WE OFFR SUPPORT 4 DIS PACKAGE **ONLY** ON MACHINEZ DAT CANT USE `generic` VARIANT ABOOV (E.G. `linux-x86`), AN ONLY WIF UP-2-DATE RUNTIME (E.G. LATEST MONO).

### OS-SPECIFIC

OS-SPECIFIC PACKAGE, APART FRUM MANAGD CODE INCLUDD IN GENERIC PACKAGE, ALSO INCLUDEZ NATIV CODE 4 GIVEN PLATFORM. IN OTHR WERDZ, OS-SPECIFIC PACKAGE **ALREADY INCLUDEZ PROPR .NET CORE RUNTIME INSIDE**, WHICH ALLOWS U 2 ENTIRELY SKIP TEH WHOLE INSTALLASHUN MES AN JUS LAUNCH ASF DIRECTLY. OS-SPECIFIC PACKAGE, AS U CAN GUES FRUM TEH NAYM, IZ OS-SPECIFIC AN EVRY OS REQUIREZ ITZ OWN VERSHUN - 4 EXAMPLE WINDOWS REQUIREZ PE32+ `ArchiSteamFarm.exe` BINARY WHILE LINUX WERKZ WIF UNIX ELF `ArchiSteamFarm` BINARY. AS U CUD KNOE, DOSE 2 TYPEZ R NOT COMPATIBLE WIF EACH OTHR.

ASF IZ CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN FOLLOWIN OS-SPECIFIC VARIANTS:

- `win-x64` WERKZ ON 64-BIT WINDOWS OSEZ. DIS INCLUDEZ WINDOWS 7 (SP1+), 8.1, 10, SERVR 2012 R2, 2016, AS WELL AS FUCHUR VERSHUNS.
- `linux-arm` WERKZ ON 32-BIT ARM-BASD (ARMV7+) GNU/LINUX OSEZ. DIS INCLUDEZ PLATFORMS SUCH AS RASPBERRY PI 2 (AN NEWR) WIF ALL GNU/LINUX OSEZ AVAILABLE 4 THEM (SUCH AS RASPBIAN), IN CURRENT AN FUCHUR VERSHUNS. DIS VARIANT WILL NOT WERK WIF OLDR ARM ARCHITECTUREZ, SUCH AS ARMV6 FINDZ IN RASPBERRY PI 0 & 1, IT WILL ALSO NOT WERK WIF OSEZ DAT DO NOT IMPLEMENT REQUIRD GNU/LINUX ENVIRONMENT (SUCH AS ANDROID).
- `linux-arm64` WERKZ ON 64-BIT ARM-BASD (ARMV8+) GNU/LINUX OSEZ. DIS INCLUDEZ PLATFORMS SUCH AS RASPBERRY PI 3 (AN NEWR) WIF ALL AARCH64 GNU/LINUX OSEZ AVAILABLE 4 THEM (SUCH AS DEBIAN), IN CURRENT AN FUCHUR VERSHUNS. DIS VARIANT WILL NOT WERK WIF 32-BIT OSEZ DAT DO NOT HAS REQUIRD 64-BIT LIBRARIEZ AVAILABLE (SUCH AS RASPBIAN), IT WILL ALSO NOT WERK WIF OSEZ DAT DO NOT IMPLEMENT REQUIRD GNU/LINUX ENVIRONMENT (SUCH AS ANDROID).
- `linux-x64` WERKZ ON 64-BIT GNU/LINUX OSEZ. DIS INCLUDEZ ALPINE, SENTOS/FEDORA/RHEL, DEBIAN/UBUNTU/LINUX MINT, OPENSUSE/SLEZ AN LOTZ DA OTHR ONEZ, INCLUDIN THEIR DERIVATIVEZ, IN CURRENT AN FUCHUR VERSHUNS.
- `osx-x64` WERKZ ON 64-BIT OS X OSEZ. DIS INCLUDEZ 10.13, AS WELL AS FUCHUR VERSHUNS.

OV COURSE, EVEN IF U DOAN HAS OS-SPECIFIC PACKAGE AVAILABLE 4 UR OS-ARCHITECCHUR COMBINASHUN, U CAN ALWAYS INSTALL APPROPRIATE .NET CORE RUNTIME YOURSELF AN RUN GENERIC ASF FLAVR, WHICH IZ ALSO TEH MAIN REASON Y IT EXISTS IN DA FURST PLACE. GENERIC ASF BUILD IZ PLATFORM-AGNOSTIC AN WILL RUN ON ANY PLATFORM DAT HAS WERKIN .NET CORE RUNTIME. DIS AR TEH IMPORTANT 2 NOWT - ASF REQUIREZ .NET CORE RUNTIME, NOT SUM SPECIFIC OS OR ARCHITECCHUR. 4 EXAMPLE, IF URE RUNNIN 32-BIT WINDOWS DEN DESPITE OV NO DEDICATD `win-x86` ASF VERSHUN, U CAN STILL INSTALL .NET CORE SDK IN `win-x86` VERSHUN AN RUN GENERIC ASF JUS FINE. WE SIMPLY CANT TARGET EVRY OS-ARCHITECCHUR COMBINASHUN DAT EXISTS AN IZ USD BY SOMEBODY, SO WE HAS 2 DRAW LINE SOMEWHERE. X86 IZ GUD EXAMPLE OV DAT LINE, AS IZ OBSOLETE ARCHITECCHUR SINCE AT LEAST 2004.

## RUNTIME REQUIREMENTS

IF URE USIN OS-SPECIFIC PACKAGE DEN U DOAN NED 2 WORRY BOUT RUNTIME REQUIREMENTS, CUZ ASF ALWAYS SHIPS WIF REQUIRD AN UP-2-DATE RUNTIME DAT WILL WERK PROPERLY AS LONG AS U HAS **[.NET CORE PREREQUIZIETS](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/Documentation/prereqs.md)** INSTALLD AN UP-2-DATE. IN OTHR WERDZ, **U DOAN NED 2 INSTALL .NET CORE RUNTIME OR SDK**, AS OS-SPECIFIC BUILDZ REQUIRE ONLY NATIV OS DEPENDENCIEZ (PREREQUIZIETS) AN NOTHIN ELSE.

HOWEVR, IF URE TRYIN 2 RUN **GENERIC** ASF PACKAGE DEN U MUST ENSURE DAT UR .NET CORE RUNTIME SUPPORTS PLATFORM REQUIRD BY ASF.

ASF AS PROGRAM IZ TARGETIN **.NET 5.0** (`net5.0`) RITE NAO, BUT IT CUD TARGET NEWR PLATFORM IN DA FUCHUR. `net5.0` IZ SUPPORTD SINCE 5.0.100 SDK (5.0.0 RUNTIME), ALTHOUGH ASF IZ CONFIGURD 2 TARGET **LATEST RUNTIME AT TEH MOMENT OV COMPILASHUN**, SO U SHUD ENSURE DAT U HAS **[LATEST SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)** (OR AT LEAST RUNTIME) AVAILABLE 4 UR MACHINE. GENERIC ASF VARIANT CUD REFUSE 2 LAUNCH IF UR RUNTIME IZ OLDR THAN TEH MINIMUM (TARGET) WAN KNOWN DURIN COMPILASHUN.

If in doubt, check what our **[continuous integration uses](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/actions/workflows/publish.yml?query=branch%3Amain)** for compiling and deploying ASF releases on GitHub. You can find `dotnet --info` output in every build as part of .NET verification step.
