# 發布週期

ASF使用常見的C＃版本控制，即A.B.C.D. ，在**[GitHub](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/releases)**上發布當前版本後，版本號即會遞進。 到目前為止發布的每個版本都可以在 GitHub 上以凍結狀態獲得，並且不會隨著時間消失，因此它總是可以回滾到其中任何一個版本，而無需進行備份。

In general ASF versioning is very simple - we use numbers from 0 to 9 in place of A, B, C and D. Version bump increments D, if new D would result in number 10, we increment C instead and set D back to 0, and so on. 新版本的發布應該被視為 ASF 里程碑，一個實現了給定功能集並準備好進行測試/使用的版本，同時與之前版本相比沒有引起任何功能倒退。 Sometimes we may decide that introduced changes are very important and bump C, B or even A instead, although that is quite rare (and usually indicates some breaking changes).

ASF版本分為兩類——穩定版和預發布版本。

與之前版本相比，穩定版本應該正常工作，沒有任何已知的功能倒退（在發佈時）。 我們傾向於在較長時間的預發布測試之後，或為修復先前版本的錯誤而發布穩定版本，而不引入新版本。 In very rare scenario (e.g. Steam breaking change) we may also decide to release new stable version ASAP, if needed. In general though, those versions should usually work very decent, as we do not mark a version as stable if it results in worse overall health condition compared to previous stable release. Of course, such "overall health" is based on reports and feedback that we're receiving during pre-release development, so sadly it's still possible that some bugs can slip through and will be discovered after stable release, simply because nobody of us ran into it during development phase. 對我們來說幸運的是，很少發生類似這樣的事情，我們傾向於在另一個後續穩定版本中盡快修復它。

預發布版本的更新更頻繁，通常會引入正在進行中的更改，建議或新實現。 Pre-release is not guaranteed to be stable, although we're always trying to do some bare tests before pushing it to GitHub, so it should never be a version that is completely broken in terms of practical usage. 預發布的主要目的是從更高級的用戶那裏獲得反饋，並在發布穩定版本之前捕獲新引入的錯誤（如果有的話）。 這項工作的質量很大程度上取決於測試人員的數量，GitHub上報告的錯誤和常規反饋。

預發布應該**通常**與穩定版本一樣好，並且這兩者之間的唯一區別僅僅是參與測試的用戶數目。 這是因為ASF是一個滾動項目，這意味著它應該可以在**任何**給定的時間點構建和使用，並且版本控制是為了您的方便——作為一個版本之間的變化的里程碑 和另一個。 Still, if you decide to use pre-releases, you should typically be a bit more advanced user, as pre-releases are usually work-in-progress smaller ASF milestones, and it's totally possible that even if something seems to be working decent, it may have stuff that isn't necessarily working or tested yet - tracking ASF development on GitHub and carefully reading changelogs is the minimum that you must do if you want to use pre-releases (for your own good). 除此之外，有時我們會主動測試特定的內容，例如配置更改、給定事物的新重寫代碼或核心更改。 Always read changelog in this case, as such pre-release version could be more unstable than other ones.

Please note that newly introduced features and changes may be undocumented (e.g. on the wiki) until some time later, as documentation is usually written once final code of given feature is ready (to save us time rewriting documentation each time we decide to modify the feature we're currently working on). Due to the fact that pre-release may contain work-in-progress code that doesn't have a final form yet, documentation will arrive at later stage of the development. Same thing applies to general changelog that may be unavailable for given pre-release until some time later. 因此，如果您決定使用預發布版本，那麼請時常查看ASF** [commits](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/commits/master) ** 。

當然，缺少文檔**僅會影響**預發布版本——每個穩定版本始終在發布時必須擁有完整的更改日誌和wiki文檔。

A pre-release version may be considered stable after some time. This is especially true if there are no changes done in the meantime, and there is no point in version bump just for the sake of stable release. It's also done very often when pre-release is considered "stable release candidate", as it allows advanced users to test it before it gets marked as stable, so the risk of introducing bugs is much lower, therefore this is the most common pattern when it comes to ASF releases:

    Stable 1.0 -> Pre 1.1 -> Pre 1.2 -> ... -> Pre 1.7 (RC) -> Stable 1.7 (same as Pre 1.7)
    

總體而言，ASF版本會在準備就緒時發布，發布時間不可預測。 通常在任何主要功能或更改結束時都會發布預發布版本，如果在預發布可用之後的一段時間（幾天）內沒有發現錯誤，則會發布穩定版本。 We're aiming for more or less **one stable release per month**, unless there are some critical issues to deal with or likewise. Pre-releases are happening on as-needed basis when we feel like there is enough of stuff that needs to be tested since the release of the last one. Depending on how busy ASF development is in given moment, this can be from a few to a dozen of pre-releases between each stable release.

The precise changelog that compares one version to another is always available on GitHub - through commits and code changes. 在發布中，我們傾向於僅記錄我們認為在上次穩定版本和當前版本之間重要的更改。 Such brief changelog is never a complete one, so if you'd like to see every change that happened between one version and another - please use GitHub for that.

ASF project is powered by continuous integration process and tested by two independent services - **[AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm)** which tests ASF on Windows, and **[Travis](https://travis-ci.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm)** which tests ASF on Linux and OS X. Every build is supposed to be reproducible, therefore it should not be a problem to grab source (included in release) of given version and compile yourself receiving the same result as the one available through a binary.

As an extra, in addition to ASF stable releases and pre-releases, you can also find latest automated AppVeyor build **[here](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm)** which is typically built from latest not-yet-included-anywhere commit. Due to automation and lack of any tests, those builds are **NOT** supported in any way, and typically are available only for developers that need to grab most recent ASF GitHub snapshot in object form, so they won't need to compile themselves. Nothing guarantees that ASF in `master` state will work properly. In rare cases, those builds can also be used for verifying if given not-yet-released commit indeed fixed particular issue or bug, without waiting for the change to land in pre-release. If you decide to use those automated builds, please ensure that you have decent knowledge in terms of ASF, as it's the highest "level" of bugged software. Unless you have a strong reason, usually you're already on the bleeding edge by tracking pre-release builds - AppVeyor builds are offered as an extra to pre-releases, mainly for verifying if given commit fixed particular issue we're working on right now. Those builds should not be used in any production environment.
