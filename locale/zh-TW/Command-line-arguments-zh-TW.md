# 指令參數

ASF 支援一些能夠影響程式執行階段的指令參數。 進階使用者可使用這些參數以定義程式執行方式。 相較使用 `ASF.json `設定檔的預設方式，指令參數可用於核心初始化（如` --path`）、平台特定設定（如` --system-required`）或敏感資料（如` --cryptkey`）。

---

## 使用

使用方法取決於您的作業系統和ASF偏好。

通用：

```shell
dotnet ArchiSteamFarm.dll --參數 --另一個參數
```

Windows：

```powershell
.\ArchiSteamFarm.exe --參數 --另一個參數
```

Linux/OS X:

```shell
./ArchiSteamFarm --參數 --另一個參數
```

指令參數也可用於通用輔助腳本中，例如`ArchiSteamFarm.cmd`或`ArchiSteamFarm.sh`。 除此之外，如在 **[Docker](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Docker-zh-TW#指令參數)** 章節中所述，使用輔助腳本時，您也可使用 `ASF_ARGS` 環境屬性。

若您的參數中存在空格，請務必要使用引號將其括住。 兩個錯誤示例：

```shell
./ArchiSteamFarm --path /home/archi/My Downloads/ASF # 錯誤！
./ArchiSteamFarm --path=/home/archi/My Downloads/ASF # 錯誤！
```

兩個正確示例：

```shell
./ArchiSteamFarm --path "/home/archi/My Downloads/ASF" # 正確
./ArchiSteamFarm "--path=/home/archi/My Downloads/ASF" # 正確
```

## 參數

`--cryptkey <key>` 或 `--cryptkey=<key>` - 將以自訂的密鑰 `<key>` 啟動 ASF。 This option affects **[security](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Security)** and will cause ASF to use your custom provided `<key>` key instead of default one hardcoded into the executable. Since this property affects default encryption key (for encrypting purposes) as well as salt (for hashing purposes), keep in mind that everything encrypted/hashed with this key will require it to be passed on each ASF run.

Due to the nature of this property, it's also possible to set cryptkey by declaring `ASF_CRYPTKEY` environment variable, which may be more appropriate for people that would want to avoid sensitive details in the process arguments.

---

`--ignore-unsupported-environment` - will cause ASF to ignore problems related to running in unsupported environment, which normally is signalized with an error and a forced exit. Unsupported environment includes for example running .NET Framework build on platform that could be running .NET Core build instead, or running ASF process as administrator (root), which causes a security risk for the host machine for absolutely no reason. While this flag will allow ASF to attempt running in such scenarios, be advised that we do not support those officially and you're forcing ASF to do it entirely **at your own risk**. As of today, **all** of the unsupported environment scenarios can be corrected, such as running `generic` build instead of `generic-netf`, or creating a dedicated user account for ASF instead of running it as root. We strongly recommend to fix the outstanding problems instead of declaring this argument.

---

`--network-group <group>` or `--network-group=<group>` - will cause ASF to init its limiters with a custom network group of `<group>` value. This option affects running ASF in **[multiple instances](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Compatibility#multiple-instances)** by signalizing that given instance is dependent only on instances sharing the same network group, and independent of the rest. Typically you want to use this property only if you're routing ASF requests through custom mechanism (e.g. different IP addresses) and you want to set networking groups yourself, without relying on ASF to do it automatically (which currently includes taking into account `WebProxy` only). Keep in mind that when using a custom network group, this is unique identifier within the local machine, and ASF will not take into account any other details, such as `WebProxy` value, allowing you to e.g. start two instances with different `WebProxy` values which are still dependent on each other.

Due to the nature of this property, it's also possible to set the value by declaring `ASF_NETWORK_GROUP` environment variable, which may be more appropriate for people that would want to avoid sensitive details in the process arguments.

---

`--no-config-migrate` - by default ASF will automatically migrate your config files to latest syntax. Migration includes conversion of deprecated properties into latest ones, removing properties with default values (as they have no effect), as well as cleaning up the file in general (correcting indentation and likewise). This is almost always a good idea, but you might have a particular situation where you'd prefer ASF to never overwrite the config files automatically. For example, you might want to `chmod 400` your config files (read permission for the owner only) or put `chattr +i` over them, in result denying write access for everyone, e.g. as a security measure. Usually we recommend to keep the config migration enabled, but if you have a particular reason for disabling it and would instead prefer ASF to not do that, you can use this switch for achieving that purpose.

---

`--no-config-watch` - by default ASF sets up a `FileSystemWatcher` over your `config` directory in order to listen for events related to file changes, so it can interactively adapt to them. For example, this includes stopping bots on config deletion, restarting bot on config being changed, or loading keys into **[BGR](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Background-games-redeemer)** once you drop them into the `config` directory. This switch allows you to disable such behaviour, which will cause ASF to completely ignore all the changes in `config` directory, requiring from you to do such actions manually, if deemed appropriate. Usually we recommend to keep the config events enabled, but if you have a particular reason for disabling them and would instead prefer ASF to not do that, you can use this switch for achieving that purpose.

---

`--no-restart` - this switch is mainly used by our **[docker](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Docker)** containers and forces `AutoRestart` of `false`. Unless you have a particular need, you should instead configure `AutoRestart` property directly in your config. This switch is here so our docker script won't need to touch your global config in order to adapt it to its own environment. 當然，如果是在腳本中執行 ASF，您也可以使用此開關（否則您最好使用全域設定檔內容）。

---

`--path <path>` or `--path=<path>` - ASF 會在啟動後使用程式所在的資料夾。 通過設定此參數，ASF 會在初始化後使用指定的資料夾，讓您能為不同設定（包括 `config`、`plugins` 和 `www` 資料夾，以及 `NLog.config` 檔案）使用不同的資料夾而不用重複複製執行檔至各別資料夾。 如果您想將二進位檔和實際設定檔分開，這可能會非常有用，正如 Linux 封裝機制——這樣您就可以在多個設定檔中使用一個（最新的）二進位檔。 此路徑既可以是基於 ASF 二進位檔案所在位置的相對路徑，也可以是絕對路徑。 Keep in mind that this command points to new "ASF home" - the directory that has the same structure as original ASF, with config directory inside, see below example for explanation.

Due to the nature of this property, it's also possible to set expected path by declaring `ASF_PATH` environment variable, which may be more appropriate for people that would want to avoid sensitive details in the process arguments.

If you're considering using this command-line argument for running multiple instances of ASF, we recommend reading our **[compatibility page](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Compatibility#multiple-instances)** on this manner.

範例:

```shell
dotnet /opt/ASF/ArchiSteamFarm.dll --path /opt/TargetDirectory # 絕對路徑
dotnet /opt/ASF/ArchiSteamFarm.dll --path ../TargetDirectory # 或相對路徑
ASF_PATH=/opt/TargetDirectory dotnet /opt/ASF/ArchiSteamFarm.dll # 或環境變數
```

```text
├── /opt
│     ├── ASF
│     │     ├── ArchiSteamFarm.dll
│     │     └── ...
│     └── TargetDirectory
│           ├── config
│           ├── logs（自動產生的）
│           ├── plugins（可省略）
│           ├── www（可省略）
│           ├── log.txt（自動產生的）
│           └── NLog.config（可省略）
└── ...
```

`--process-required` - declaring this switch will disable default ASF behaviour of shutting down when no bots are running. No auto-shutdown behaviour is especially useful in combination with **[IPC](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/IPC)** where majority of users would expect their web service to be running regardless of the amount of bots that are enabled. If you're using IPC option or otherwise need ASF process to be running all the time until you close it yourself, this is the right option.

If you do not intend to run IPC, this option will be rather useless for you, as you can just start the process again when needed (as opposed to ASF's web server where you require it listening all the time in order to send commands).

---

`--service` - this switch is mainly used by our `systemd` service and forces `Headless` of `true`. Unless you have a particular need, you should instead configure `Headless` property directly in your config. This switch is here so our `systemd` service won't need to touch your global config in order to adapt it to its own environment. Of course, if you have a similar need then you may also make use of this switch (otherwise you're better with global config property).

---

`--system-required` - declaring this switch will cause ASF to try signalizing the OS that the process requires system to be up and running for its entire lifetime. Currently this switch has effect only on Windows machines where it'll forbid your system from going into sleep mode as long as the process is running. This can be proven especially useful when farming on your PC or laptop during night, as ASF will be able to keep your system awake while it's farming, then, once ASF is done, it'll shutdown itself like usual, making your system allowed to enter into sleep mode again, therefore saving power immediately once farming is finished.

Keep in mind that for proper auto-shutdown of ASF you need other settings - especially avoiding `--process-required` and ensuring that all your bots are following `ShutdownOnFarmingFinished`. 當然，自動關閉只是這個參數的用法之一，因為您還可以將此參數配合 `--process-required` 使用，使您的作業系統在 ASF 啟動之後無限運行下去。
