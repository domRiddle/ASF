# Perdagangan

ASF includes support for Steam non-interactive (offline) trades. Both receiving (accepting/declining) as well as sending trades is available right away and doesn't require special configuration, but obviously requires unrestricted Steam account (the one that spent 5$ in the store already). Trading module is unavailable for restricted accounts.

## Logic

ASF will always accept all trades, regardless of items, sent from user with `Master` (or higher) access to the bot. This allows not only easily looting steam cards farmed by the bot instance, but also allows to easily manage Steam items that bot stashes in the inventory - including those from other games (such as CS:GO).

ASF will reject trade offer, regardless of content, from any (non-master) user that is blacklisted from trading module. Blacklist is stored in standard `BotName.db` database, and can be managed via `tb`, `tbadd` and `tbrm` **[commands](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands)**. This should work as an alternative to standard user block offered by Steam - use with caution.

ASF will accept all `loot`-like trades being sent across bots, unless `DontAcceptBotTrades` is specified in `TradingPreferences`. In short, default `TradingPreferences` of `None` will cause ASF to automatically accept trades from user with `Master` access to the bot (explained above), as well as all donation trades from other bots that are taking part in ASF process. If you want to disable donation trades from other bots, then that's what `DontAcceptBotTrades` in your `TradingPreferences` is for.

When you enable `AcceptDonations` in your `TradingPreferences`, ASF will also accept any donation trade - a trade in which bot account is not losing any items. This property affects only non-bot accounts, as bot accounts are affected by `DontAcceptBotTrades`. `AcceptDonations` allows you to easily accept donations from other people, and also bots that are not taking part in ASF process.

It's nice to note that `AcceptDonations` doesn't require **[ASF 2FA](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Two-factor-authentication)**, as there is no confirmation needed if we're not losing any items.

You can also further customize ASF trading capabilities by modifying `TradingPreferences` accordingly. One of the main `TradingPreferences` features is `SteamTradeMatcher` option which will cause ASF to use built-in logic for accepting trades that help you complete missing badges, which is especially useful in cooperation with public listing of **[SteamTradeMatcher](https://www.steamtradematcher.com)**, but can also work without it. It's further described below.

## `SteamTradeMatcher`

When `SteamTradeMatcher` is active, ASF will use quite complex algorithm of checking if trade passes STM rules and is at least neutral towards us. The actual logic is following:

- Reject the trade if we're losing anything but item types specified in our `MatchableTypes`.
- Reject the trade if we're not receiving at least the same number of items on per-game, per-type and per-rarity basis.
- Reject the trade if user asks for special Steam summer/winter sale cards, and has a trade hold.
- Reject the trade if trade hold duration exceeds `MaxTradeHoldDuration` global config property.
- Reject the trade if we don't have `MatchEverything` set, and it's worse than neutral for us.
- Accept the trade if we didn't reject it through any of the points above.

It's nice to note that ASF also supports overpaying - the logic will work properly when user is adding something extra to the trade, as long as all above conditions are met.

First 4 reject predicates should be obvious for everyone. The final one includes actual dupes logic which checks current state of our inventory and decides what is the status of the trade.

- Trade is **good** if our progress towards set completion advances. Example: A A (before) -> A B (after)
- Trade is **neutral** if our progress towards set completion stays in-tact. Example: A B (before) -> A C (after)
- Trade is **bad** if our progress towards set completion declines. Example: A C (before) -> A A (after)

STM operates only on good trades, which means that user using STM for dupes matching should always suggest only good trades for us. However, ASF is liberal, and it also accepts neutral trades, because in those trades we're not actually losing anything, so there is no real reason to decline them. This is especially useful for your friends, since they can swap your excessive cards without using STM at all, as long as you're not losing any set progress.

By default ASF will reject bad trades - this is almost always what you want as an user. However, you can optionally enable `MatchEverything` in your `TradingPreferences` in order to make ASF accept all dupe trades, including **bad ones**. This is useful only if you want to run a 1:1 trade bot under your account, as you understand that **ASF will no longer help you progress towards badge completion, and make you prone to losing entire finished set for N dupes of the same card**. Unless you intentionally want to run a trade bot that is **never** supposed to finish any set, you don't want to enable this option.

Regardless of your chosen `TradingPreferences`, a trade being rejected by ASF doesn't mean that you can't accept it yourself. If you kept default value of `BotBehaviour`, which doesn't include `RejectInvalidTrades`, ASF will just ignore those trades - allowing you to decide yourself if you're interested in them or not. Same goes for trades with items outside of `MatchableTypes`, as well as everything else - the module is supposed to help you automate STM trades, not decide what is a good trade and what is not. The only exception from this rule is when talking about users that you blacklisted from trading module using `tbadd` command - trades from those users are immediately rejected regardless of `BotBehaviour` settings.

It's highly recommended to use **[ASF 2FA](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Two-factor-authentication)** when you enable this option, as this function loses its whole potential if you decide to manually confirm every trade. `SteamTradeMatcher` will work properly even without ability to confirm trades, but it can generate backlog of confirmations if you're not accepting them in time.

### `MatchActively`

`MatchActively` setting is extended version of `SteamTradeMatcher` which in addition to passive matching offered by that option, also includes active matching in which the bot will send trades to other people.

In order to make use of that option, you have a set of requirements to meet. Firstly, you need to enable `SteamTradeMatcher` (as this feature is extension of that), and ensure that you have `MatchEverything` **disabled** (as trading bots never match actively). Afterwards, you have to be eligible for our **[ASF STM listing](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Statistics#current-privacy-policy)**, with a bit relaxed requirements. At the minimum you must have `Statistics` enabled, **[unrestricted](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3330-IAGK-7663)** account, **[ASF 2FA](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Two-factor-authentication#asf-2fa)** active and at least one valid type in `MatchableTypes`, such as trading cards.

If you meet all of the requirements above, ASF will periodically communicate with our **[public ASF STM listing](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Statistics#public-asf-stm-listing)** in order to actively match bots that are currently available.

- Each matching session is composed of "rounds", with `10` being maximum in a single matching session.
- In each round ASF will fetch our inventory and inventory of selected bots that are listed in order to find `MatchableTypes` items that can be matched. If match is found, ASF will send and confirm trade offer automatically.
- Each set (composition of appID, type and rarity of the item) can be matched in a single round only once. This is implemented in order to minimize "items no longer available" and avoid a need to wait for each bot to react before sending all the trades. It's also the primary reason why matching is composed of rounds and not one ongoing process.
- ASF will send no more than `255` items in a single trade, and no more than `5` trades to a single user in a single round. This is imposed by Steam limits, as well as our own load-balancing.
- ASF has a hard limit of `40` unique bots that can be matched in a single round, if not cancelled before due to running out of sets to match - in this case, during the next round ASF will try to match bots that weren't matched yet firstly.
- If ASF determines that the matching should continue, next round starts within `5` minutes since the last one (to add some cooldown and allow all bots to react to our trades), otherwise matching session ends and repeats itself in `8` hours.

This module is supposed to be transparent. Matching will start in approximately `1` hour since ASF start, and will repeat itself each `8` hours (if needed). `MatchActively` feature is aimed to be used as a long-run, periodical measure to ensure that we're actively heading towards sets completion, but without a short-term time and resources pressure that would happen if this was offered as a command. The target users of this module are primary accounts and "stash" alt accounts, although it can be used by any bot that is not set to `MatchEverything`.

ASF does its best to minimize the amount of requests and pressure generated by using this option, while at the same time maximizing efficiency of matching to the upper limit. The exact algorithm of choosing the bots to match and otherwise organize the whole process, is ASF's implementation detail and can change in regards to feedback, situation and possible future ideas.

The current version of the algorithm makes ASF prioritize `Any` bots first, especially those with better diversity of games that their items are from. When running out of `Any` bots, ASF will move on to the fair ones upon same diversity rule, with those owning excessive number of items further deprioritized due to higher chance of possible inventory-related problems compared to other bots. Regardless of that, ASF will try to match every available bot at least once, to ensure that we're not missing on a possible set progress.

`MatchActively` takes into account bots that you blacklisted from trading through `tbadd` **[command](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands)** and will not attempt to actively match them. This can be used for telling ASF which bots it should never match, even if they'd have potential dupes for us to use.
