### Why do I need a `LicenseID` to use the plugin? Wasn't `MatchActively` free before?

ASF is, and remains, free and open-source, as it was established at the start of the project back in October 2015. Our program is also entirely non-commercial, we do not earn anything from contributions to it, building or publishing. Over those past 7+ years ASF has received tremendous amount of development, and it's still being improved and enhanced with every monthly stable release mostly by a single person, **[JustArchi](https://github.com/JustArchi)** - with no strings attached. The only funding we receive is from non-obligatory donations that come from our users.

For a very long time, until October 2022, `MatchActively` feature was part of ASF core and available for everyone to use. In October 2022, Valve, the company behind Steam, has put very severe rate limits that rendered previous functionality entirely broken, with no solution available. The feature therefore has been removed from ASF core in version 5.4.1.0.

`MatchActively` was resurrected as part of official `ItemsMatcher` plugin that further enhances ASF with active cards matching functionality. Resurrecting `MatchActively` feature required from us extraordinary amount of work to create ASF backend, entirely new service hosted on a server, with more than a thousand of proxies attached for resolving inventories, all exclusively to allow ASF clients to make use of `MatchActively` like before. Due to the amount of work involved, as well as resources that are not free and require to be paid on monthly basis by us (domain, server, proxies), we've decided to offer this plugin to our sponsors, that is, people that already support ASF project on monthly basis. Our goal isn't to profit from it, but rather, cover the **monthly costs** that are exclusively linked with offering this functionality - that's why we offer it basically for nothing, but we do have to charge a little for it as we can't pay hundreds of dollars from our own pockets just to make it available for you. We hope that you understand.

### How can I get an access?

`ItemsMatcher` is offered as part of $5+ sponsor tier on **[JustArchi's GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/JustArchi)**. Simply become a sponsor of $5 tier (or higher), then click **[here](https://asf-backend.justarchi.net/user/status)** to obtain your `LicenseID`. You'll need to sign in with GitHub for confirming your identity.

The license allows you to send limited amount of requests to the server. $5 tier allows you to use `MatchActively` for one account, which should be suitable for majority of people. $10 tier allows you to use it on three accounts. If you require more resources, **[let us know](mailto:ASF@JustArchi.net)**.

`LicenseID` is made out of 32 hexadecimal characters, such as `f6a0529813f74d119982eb4fe43a9a24`. Simply put it in `LicenseID` property of ASF global config.
